      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) This subpart discusses the policy for the use of a program opportunity notice solicitation approach to accelerate the demonstration of the technical feasibility and commercial application of all potentially beneficial nonnuclear energy sources and utilization technologies.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) This subpart applies to demonstrations performed by individuals, educational institutions, commercial or industrial organizations, or other private entities, public entities, including State and local governments, but not other Federal agencies. For purposes of this subpart, commercial demonstration projects include demonstrations of technological advances, field demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstration of prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of non-nuclear energy resources.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) It is DOE's intent to encourage the submission of proposals to accelerate the demonstration of the technical, operational, economic, and commercial feasibility and environmental acceptability of particular energy technologies, systems, subsystems, and components. Program opportunity notices will be used to provide information concerning scientific and technological areas encompassed by DOE's programs. DOE shall, from time to time, issue program opportunity notices for proposals for demonstrations of various forms of non-nuclear energy and technology utilization.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Each program opportunity notice shall as a minimum describe: the goal of the intended demonstration effort; the time schedule for award; evaluation criteria; program policy factors; the amount of cost detail required; and proposal submission information. Program policy factors are those factors which, while not appropriate indicators of a proposal's individual merit (i.e., technical excellence, proposer's ability, cost, etc.), are relevant and essential to the process of choosing which of the proposals received will, taken together, best achieve the program objectives. All such factors shall be predetermined and specified in the notice so as to notify proposers that factors which are essentially beyond their control will affect the selection process.
