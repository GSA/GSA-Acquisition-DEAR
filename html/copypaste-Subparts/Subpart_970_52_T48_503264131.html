      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">This subpart prescribes some of the solicitation provisions and contract clauses for use in management and operating contracts. The provisions and clauses contained in this subpart supplement the provisions and clauses prescribed in the FAR and in other parts of the DEAR (48 CFR 901 through 48 CFR 952), and, pursuant to the individual provision or clause prescription, are to be used in addition to or in place of such clauses. Management and operating contracts are hybrid contracts, in some cases including aspects of several FAR contract types, for example, supplies and construction. For some FAR solicitation provisions and contract clauses, this subpart prescribes their use despite the hybrid nature of the work required. To assist Departmental contracting personnel in determining the applicability of FAR and DEAR clauses to management and operating contracts, additional guidance is published and made available by the Office of Procurement and Assistance Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled activities.
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Atomic Energy Act, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act; the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended; or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act; or the regulations that implement those statutes (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> the ITAR, the EAR, 10 CFR part 110 and 10 CFR part 810). Thus, if items (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> commodities, software or technologies) that are controlled by U.S. export control laws or regulations are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Contractor Request to Assert Copyright. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) For data other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes, (B) The program under which it was funded, (C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement, (D) Whether the data is subject to export control, (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period, and (F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained.

			would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes, (B) would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data, (C) would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness, (D) would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements, or (E) would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified under this Contract as well as those additional treaties and international agreements which DOE may from time to time identify by unilateral amendment to the Contract; such amendment listing added treaties and international agreements is effective only for data which is developed after the date such treaty or international agreement is added to this Contract. Also, the Contractor will not be permitted to assert copyright in data in the form of various technical reports generated by the Contractor under the Contract without first obtaining the advanced written permission of the contracting officer. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) DOE Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 90 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor.

			An abstract describing the software suitable for publication, (B) the source code for each software program, and (C) the object code and at least the minimum support documentation needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software. The Patent Counsel, for good cause shown by the Contractor, may allow the minimum support documentation to be delivered within 60 days after permission to assert copyright is given or at such time the minimum support documentation becomes available. The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause above, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) For a five year period or such other specified period as specifically approved by Patent Counsel beginning on the date the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Upon request, the initial period may be extended after DOE approval. The DOE approval will be based on the standard that the work is still commercially available and the market demand is being met. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) After the period approved by Patent Counsel for application of the limited Government license described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this clause, or if, prior to the end of such period(s), the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, published, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be as follows: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. ______________ with the Department of Energy. For (period approved by DOE Patent Counsel) from (date permission to assert copyright was obtained), the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. There is provision for the possible extension of the term of this license. Subsequent to that period or any extension granted, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data , apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.

Before licensing under this subparagraph (vi), DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65 - ”Appeals.”

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Expressly unallowable, then the Contracting Officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to this contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the submission.</p>

The Contractor's purchasing performance will be evaluated against such performance criteria and measures as may be set forth elsewhere in this contract. DOE reserves the right at any time to require that the Contractor submit for approval any or all purchases under this contract. The Contractor shall not purchase any item or service, the purchase of which is expressly prohibited by the written direction of DOE, and shall use such special and directed sources as may be expressly required by the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE will conduct periodic appraisals of the Contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including the Contractor's compliance with its approved system and methods. Such appraisals will be performed through the conduct of Contractor Purchasing System Reviews in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 44.3, or, when approved by the Contracting Officer, through the Contractor's participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard performance measurement and performance management system. The Contractor's approved purchasing system and methods shall include the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (y) of this clause.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Responsibility for determining the costs allowable under each cost-reimbursement subcontract remains with the contractor or next higher-tier subcontractor. The Contractor shall provide, in appropriate cases, for the timely involvement of the Contractor and the DOE Contracting Officer in resolution of subcontract cost allowability.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Where audits of subcontractors at any tier are required, arrangements may be made to have the cognizant Federal agency perform the audit of the subcontract. These arrangements shall be made administratively between DOE and the other agency involved and shall provide for the cognizant agency to audit in an appropriate manner in light of the magnitude and nature of the subcontract. In no case, however, shall these arrangements preclude determination by the DOE Contracting Officer of the allowability or unallowability of subcontractor costs claimed for reimbursement by the Contractor.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Allowable costs for cost reimbursable subcontracts are to be determined in accordance with the cost principles of 48 CFR Part 31, appropriate for the type of organization to which the subcontract is to be awarded, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931.

			The Contractor shall require performance bonds in penal amounts as set forth in 48 CFR 28.102-2(a) for all fixed-priced and unit-priced construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000. The Contractor shall consider the use of performance bonds in fixed-price non-construction subcontracts, where appropriate.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost reimbursement construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000, a payment bond shall be obtained on Standard Form 25A modified to name the Contractor as well as the United States of America as obligees. The penal amounts shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction subcontracts greater than $25,000, but not greater than $100,000, the Contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR 28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the liability of any one surety exceed the maximum penal sum for which it is qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of acceptable corporate sureties.
</p>

The Contractor shall forward determinations of non-availability of individual items to the DOE Contracting Officer for approval. Items in excess of $500,000 require the prior concurrence of the Head of Contracting Activity. If, however, the Contractor has an approved purchasing system, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize the Contractor to make determinations of non-availability for individual items valued at $500,000 or less.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			The Contractor shall not award a subcontract for construction to the architect-engineer firm or an affiliate that prepared the design. This prohibition does not preclude the award of a “turnkey” subcontract so long as the subcontractor assumes all liability for defects in design and construction and consequential damages.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor shall not award both a cost-reimbursement subcontract and a fixed-price subcontract for construction or architect-engineer services or any combination thereof to the same firm where those subcontracts will be performed at the same site.

Subcontracts shall be in the name of the Contractor, and shall not bind or purport to bind the Government.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(k) <em class="ph i">Government Property.</em> The Contractor shall establish and maintain a property management system that complies with criteria in 48 CFR 970.5245-1, Property, and 48 CFR 52.245-1, Government Property.
