      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">This subpart prescribes some of the solicitation provisions and contract clauses for use in management and operating contracts. The provisions and clauses contained in this subpart supplement the provisions and clauses prescribed in the FAR and in other parts of the DEAR (48 CFR 901 through 48 CFR 952), and, pursuant to the individual provision or clause prescription, are to be used in addition to or in place of such clauses. Management and operating contracts are hybrid contracts, in some cases including aspects of several FAR contract types, for example, supplies and construction. For some FAR solicitation provisions and contract clauses, this subpart prescribes their use despite the hybrid nature of the work required. To assist Departmental contracting personnel in determining the applicability of FAR and DEAR clauses to management and operating contracts, additional guidance is published and made available by the Office of Procurement and Assistance Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

If agreement is reached prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, the Contracting Officer shall modify the contract to reflect the agreement. If agreement is not reached prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, the Contracting Officer will, prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, unilaterally determine: the requirements of the evaluation period including, if appropriate, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee amount, and the allocation of the total available fee amount.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Department of Energy (DOE) shall, at the conclusion of each specified evaluation period, evaluate the Contractor's performance of all requirements, and determine the total available fee amount earned. At DOE's discretion, if the contact established specific incentivized requirements and a schedule for their completion and the Contractor completes them during the evaluation period, DOE may evaluate the Contractor's performance upon the requirements' completion. The Contractor agrees the determination of the total available fee amount earned is a unilateral determination made by the Fee Determining Official (FDO). DOE will identify the FDO. The FDO will be the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or another DOE official designated by the Assistant Secretary or equivalent (not delegable).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the award fee cycle consists of one evaluation period, award fee not earned during the evaluation period shall not be allocated to future evaluation periods. At the sole discretion of DOE, if the award fee cycle consists of more than one evaluation period, award fee not earned during the evaluation period may be allocated to future evaluation periods within the same award fee cycle.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Following each evaluation period, the Contractor [insert may or shall] submit a self-assessment within [insert number] calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct them and avoid their recurrence. The FDO will review the Contractor's self-assessment as part of the evaluation of the Contractor's performance during the period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The FDO will evaluate the Contractor's performance in accordance with the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan (PEMP) described in paragraph (d) of this clause unless otherwise set forth in the contract. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the total available fee amount earned determination and the basis of the determination.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">PEMP.</em> To the extent not set forth elsewhere in the contract:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) DOE shall establish a PEMP upon which the determination of the total available fee amount earned shall be based. The PEMP will address all of the requirements of contract performance specified in the contract directly or by reference. The Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with a copy of the PEMP before the start of an evaluation period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The PEMP will set forth the criteria upon which the Contractor will be evaluated relating to any technical, schedule, management, and/or cost objectives selected for evaluation. The PEMP will include, per 48 CFR 16.402-1, a cost incentive (or constraint). The criteria in the PEMP should be objective but may also include subjective criteria. The PEMP will set forth the method by which the total available fee amount will be allocated, and the total available fee amount earned will be determined.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The PEMP may be revised, either unilaterally (by DOE) or bilaterally, during the evaluation period. If it is revised, the Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Of unilateral revisions (unless they are urgent and high priority) at least ninety calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period and at least thirty calendar days prior to the effective date of the revision;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Of bilateral revisions (unless they are urgent and high priority) at least sixty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Of urgent and high priority revisions, whether made unilaterally or bilaterally, at least thirty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Schedule for total available fee amount earned determinations.</em> The FDO shall issue the final total available fee amount earned determination in accordance with the schedule set forth in the PEMP or as otherwise set forth in this contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The determination for the evaluation period must be made within the later of: sixty calendar days after the receipt by the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's self-assessment, if one is required or permitted; seventy calendar days after the end of the evaluation period; or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the FDO elects to evaluate the Contractor's performance of any specific requirements upon their completion, the determination of any fee amount earned must be made: within seventy calendar days of the requirements' completion; or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the determination is not made within the periods stated above, the Contractor shall be entitled to interest on the total available fee amount earned at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 7109) that is in effect on the payment date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest on any late total available fee amount earned determination will accrue daily and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the schedule determination date through the actual date the determination is made. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the total available fee amount earned and be subject to interest if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.

         <p class="p HD3">Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts [December 2024]
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> “Amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period” means the quantity the Contracting Officer or Fee Determining Official determines the Contractor is due for its performance in consideration of the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan, Award Fee Plan, or similar document prior to a separate determination that the Contractor did not comply with a term or condition of the contract or experienced a failure relating to: environment, safety, and health or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. If the contract includes incentives allocable to more than one evaluation period, the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period includes the allocable amount of payment for each such incentive for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives. The allocable amount is the total amount divided by the number of evaluation periods the incentive covered. “Amount actually payable to the Contractor for an evaluation period” means: (the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period) less (the amount of any reduction under this clause and the amount of any reductions under other clauses to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">General.</em> (Note: If this contract does not include the Security Requirements clause (48 CFR 952.204-2), the requirements of this clause related to security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information do not apply.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for any evaluation period under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's and the Contractor's employees' compliance during the evaluation period with the performance requirements of this contract relating to:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Environment, safety and health (ES&amp;H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&amp;H); and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The ES&amp;H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including the DOE-approved contractor Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&amp;H compliance.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of this contract are set forth in: the clause of this contract entitled, “Security Requirements”; the clause of this contract entitled “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives”; and other terms and conditions of this contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&amp;H or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information during any evaluation period established under the contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount,” the amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or other incentives for the evaluation period may be unilaterally reduced by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Amount of Reduction.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contracting Officer will unilaterally determine the amount of reduction to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period based on the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees of failure specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause. The percent reduction for each performance failure will be: not less than 26% nor more than 100% for a first degree failure; not less than 11% or more than 26% for a second degree failure; and no more than 11% for a third degree failure.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) For a reduction allocable to more than one evaluation period, the Government will effect the allocation at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount of the reduction. The allocable amount is the total reduction amount divided by the number of evaluation periods the reduction covered.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Government will reduce the payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives as soon as practicable after the end of the evaluation period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practicable after becoming aware.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) In determining the reduction and in applying the mitigating factors, the Contracting Officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&amp;H, and security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site-specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition or guidance for the amount of reduction or for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the Contracting Office must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the reduction that would be appropriate absent mitigating factors. Mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following (paragraphs (c)(4)(v), (vi), (vii), and (viii) of this clause apply to ES&amp;H only):
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Efforts the Contractor made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: ES&amp;H and compliance in related areas; or of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related areas;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&amp;H standards are routinely practiced;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> offsite emergency response);
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&amp;H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> policy, ES&amp;H programs); and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) Contractor demonstration that an operating experience and feedback program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&amp;H by use of lessons learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Reductions to the amount of payments the Contractor has received for earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives under this and other clauses.</em>
                              </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of the reduction under this clause for an evaluation period, in combination with the amount of any reduction under any other clause, shall not exceed the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If at any time during the contract any reductions under this clause or other clauses result in the sum of the amount of payments the Contractor has received for earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives to exceed the sum of the amounts of actually payable to the Contractor, the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) At the end of the contract—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of amounts actually payable to the Contractor exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of the amounts actually payable to the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Environment, Safety and Health (ES&amp;H).</em> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, DOE directives, and the DOE approved Contractor ISMS. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of earned or fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">First Degree.</em> Performance failures most adverse to ES&amp;H are first degree. They include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS. (The Government will perform necessary reviews in a timely manner and not unreasonably withhold approval.)
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Performance failures determined, per applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, serious injury or death to a worker.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Occurrence of any accident or event that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) and results in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Second Degree.</em> Performance failures significantly adverse to ES&amp;H are second degree. They include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Failures to comply with an approved ISMS.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Failures that have been determined, per applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an actual injury, exposure, or exceedance that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences.

</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Non-compliance with applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives that results in a near miss of an accident or event that could have resulted in an adverse effect and a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board. (A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, that does not result in an adverse effect.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Third Degree.</em> Performance failures determined per applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives to reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&amp;H are third degree. They include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Non-compliance with applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in potential breakdown of the Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through: external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 231.B (or successor Order) requirements; or internal oversight of 10 CFR parts 830, 835, 850, and 851, or DOE Orders 227.1A and 436.1 (or successor Order) requirements.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this clause).

This category also includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future more severe performance failures and/or conditions that if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.

         <p class="p List3">(iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures that by themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.

         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 970.1708-3, insert the following clause:
</p>
         <p class="p HD3">Agreements for Commercializing Technology (Act) [December 2024]
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) This clause authorizes the use of the mechanism, Agreements for Commercializing Technology (ACT). In accordance with the requirements specified in this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor may conduct third party-sponsored research at the M&amp;O Contractor's risk. While the Department believes ACT has the potential to greatly assist in the commercialization of technologies, it also specifically recognizes that ACT can be used for other engagements with outside entities that are not necessary aimed at commercialization (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> technical assistance, training, studies), but that facilitate access to DOE facilities. In performing ACT work, the M&amp;O Contractor may use staff and other resources associated with this M&amp;O contract for the purposes of conducting technical services, training, studies, performing research and development, and/or furthering the technology transfer mission of the Department, only when such work does not interfere with DOE-funded activities conducted as authorized by other parts of this M&amp;O contract. Any allocation of resources that adversely affects work for DOE due to performing ACT work is the responsibility of the M&amp;O Contractor. The resources that may be used include Government-owned or leased facilities, equipment, or other property that is either in the M&amp;O Contractor's custody or available to the M&amp;O Contractor under this M&amp;O contract (unless specifically excluded by the Contracting Officer). For M&amp;O Contractor activities conducted under authority of this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor shall provide full-cost recovery, assume indemnification and liability as provided in paragraph (b)(9) below, and may assume other risks normally borne by private parties sponsoring research at the DOE national laboratories and production plants. In exchange for accepting such risks, or for other private consideration provided by the M&amp;O Contractor, the M&amp;O Contractor is authorized to negotiate separate ACT agreements with the sponsoring third parties. Under ACT agreements, the M&amp;O Contractor may charge those parties additional compensation beyond the full costs of the work at the facility.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The following applies to all work conducted under the ACT mechanism, regardless of the source of funding:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Authority to Perform work under this clause.</em> Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 <em class="ph i">et seq.</em>) and other applicable authorities, the M&amp;O Contractor may perform work for non-Federal entities, in accordance with the requirements of this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">M&amp;O Contractor's Implementation.</em> For ACT work conducted under the contract, the M&amp;O Contractor must draft, implement, and maintain formal policies, practices, and procedures in accordance with this clause, which must be approved by the Contracting Officer, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Conditions for Participation in ACT.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor: 
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Must not perform ACT activities that would place it in direct competition with the private sector;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) May only conduct work under this clause if the work does not interfere with or adversely affect projects and programs the M&amp;O Contractor conducts on behalf of the DOE under this contract, and complies with the terms and conditions of the prime contract If the Government determines that an activity conducted under this clause interferes with the Department's work under the M&amp;O contract, or that termination/stay/suspension of work under an ACT agreement is in the best interest of the Government, the M&amp;O Contractor must stop the interfering ACT work immediately to the extent necessary to resolve the interference. At any time, the Contracting Officer may require the use of specified Government-owned or leased property and facilities for the exclusive use of the DOE mission by providing a written notice excluding said property from the M&amp;O Contractor's activities under this clause. Any cost incurred as a result of Contracting Officer decisions identified in this paragraph shall be borne by the M&amp;O Contractor. The Contracting Officer shall provide to the M&amp;O Contractor in writing its decision, identifying the issues and reasons for the decisions. The M&amp;O Contractor shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to address and resolve the issues identified by the Contracting Officer;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) Except as otherwise excluded in this clause, must perform all ACT activities in accordance with the standards, policies, and procedures that apply to performance under this M&amp;O contract, including but not limited to environmental, safety and health, security, safeguards, conflict of interest and classification procedures, and human and animal research regulations;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) Must maintain and provide when requested by the DOE Contracting Officer, a summary of project information for each active ACT project, consisting of: sponsor name; total estimated costs; project title and description; project point of contact; and estimated start and completion dates;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(v) Is responsible for addressing the following items in ACT agreements as appropriate: disposition of property acquired under the agreement; export control; notice of intellectual property infringement; and a statement that the Government and/or the M&amp;O Contractor shall have the right to perform similar services in the Statement of Work for other Parties as otherwise authorized by this M&amp;O contract subject to applicable data restrictions;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vi) Must include a standard legal disclaimer notice on all publications generated under ACT activities. Each DOE M&amp;O Contractor has its own pre-approved publications statement, and this should be included; and
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vii) Must insert the following disclaimer in each agreement under ACT, which must be conspicuous (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> bold type, all capital letters, or large font) in all Agreements under ACT so as to meet the standards of due notice.

THIS DISCLAIMER DOES NOT AFFECT ANY RIGHTS THE GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE AGAINST THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM WORK CONDUCTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>
         <p class="p P Runin">(4) <em class="ph i">Contracting Authority.</em> (i) Subject to DOE approval as described in this paragraph, the M&amp;O Contractor is hereby authorized to negotiate terms and conditions between the M&amp;O Contractor and third parties when entering into ACT agreements. The M&amp;O Contractor will have no authority to bind the Government in any way with such terms and conditions. The Government will have no obligation to the M&amp;O Contractor due to such terms and conditions.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) The M&amp;O Contractor shall submit an ACT proposal package (Package) to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to beginning work under an ACT agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(A) A complete Package will include at a minimum: the identity of the parties to the ACT agreement; the principal place of performance; any foreign ownership or control of the ACT agreement parties; a Statement of Work; an estimate of costs incurred under the M&amp;O contract; an anticipated schedule; identification of key Government equipment and facilities that will be used under the ACT agreement; a list of expected deliverables; identification of the Intellectual Property (IP) lead and proposed selection of IP rights, as defined in DOE Class Waiver W(C)-2011-013; a signed certification by the private party(ies) that the M&amp;O Contractor offered the option to use Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) alternatives (see paragraph (b)(7)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			of this clause) sufficiently such that the private parties are aware of the relative costs and other differences between the ACT agreement and the CRADA and SPP alternatives; source of funds, including a statement that no Federal funds, including pass-through funds received as a subcontractor or partner, are being utilized; applicable ES&amp;H and NEPA documentation; a statement of consideration, summarizing the risk and/or consideration offered the ACT participants in exchange for charging beyond full cost recovery or for other compensation provided by the participants; and when multiple third parties are parties to the ACT agreement, or as otherwise requested by the Contracting Officer, an IP Management Plan that sets forth the proposed disposition of IP rights, and income and royalty sharing, among the parties to an ACT agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) If the M&amp;O Contractor, the M&amp;O Contractor's parent, member, subsidiary, or other entity in which the M&amp;O Contractor, the M&amp;O Contractor's parent, member or subsidiary has an equity interest, is a party to the ACT agreement, the M&amp;O Contractor shall include as necessary a project-specific addendum to the Master OCI Plan in the Package to address special circumstances not fully anticipated in the prior approved Master OCI Plan (see paragraph (b)(7) of this clause).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(C) If the ACT agreement includes a foreign entity as a party or the statement of work includes the use of human subjects, animal subjects, classified or sensitive subject matter or describes a work scope involving high risks or hazards including environmental issues, the M&amp;O Contractor shall include additional information as necessary or as requested by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) The Contracting Officer shall use reasonable best efforts to review each complete Package submitted by the M&amp;O Contractor under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this clause within 10 business days of receiving the Package and provide the M&amp;O Contractor with approval or non-approval of the Package. The review of the complete Package by the Contracting Officer shall include a determination that the proposed work: is consistent with or complementary to DOE missions and the contract statement of work; will not adversely impact programs under the contract scope of work; will not place the contractor in direct competition with the domestic private sector; and will not create a detrimental future burden on DOE resources.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) Except as conditionally allowed under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this clause, the Contracting Officer must approve the Package before the M&amp;O Contractor may begin work under the proposed ACT agreement. If the Contracting Officer rejects the Package, then the Contracting Officer must provide said rejection to the M&amp;O Contractor in writing including the reasons for the rejection. Upon receipt of the Contracting Officer's written rejection, the M&amp;O Contractor agrees to not further pursue the work described in the package or incur additional costs under the M&amp;O contract for the work described in the Package.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(A) The M&amp;O Contractor may request a preliminary determination that the proposed scope of work is consistent with the contract statement of work and the Contracting Officer will use his/her best efforts to provide such a determination within three business days. Upon such a determination from the Contracting Officer, the M&amp;O Contractor may begin work under the ACT agreement at the M&amp;O Contractor's risk pending final approval of the complete Package. The M&amp;O Contractor must submit a complete Package, as identified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this clause, within 10 business days of the preliminary determination. All costs associated with the performance of work under a preliminary determination are the responsibility of the M&amp;O Contractor, as no Federal funds will be used to fund any work conducted under this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) If any source affiliated with the M&amp;O Contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the M&amp;O Contractor or its parent company) is a party sponsoring work in connection with the ACT agreement, work may not commence until approval of the complete Package by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(5) <em class="ph i">Advance Payment for ACT Projects.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall be responsible for providing adequate advance payment for ACT work conducted under this clause consistent with procedures defined in the Department's Financial Management Handbook. The M&amp;O Contractor shall be solely responsible for collecting payments from third parties for any work conducted under this clause and such collections shall be independent of providing advance payment. For such payments and for any costs, obligations, or liabilities arising due to the M&amp;O Contractor's work under this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor is entirely at risk and the Government shall have no risk.
</p>
         <p class="p P Runin">(6) <em class="ph i">Costs and Fee.</em> (i) All direct costs associated with the M&amp;O Contractor's work conducted under this clause shall be directly charged to separate and identifiable accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Department's Financial Management Handbook. An allocable portion of indirect costs normally applied to equivalent work under this M&amp;O contract shall also be applied to work conducted under this clause in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Management Handbook. As required by the Financial Management Handbook, changes to the Handbook will be incorporated into this clause by a unilateral administrative modification to the contract. In addition, all work must be performed at full costs that would include Federal Administrative Charge (FAC).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) Work conducted under this clause shall be excluded from the M&amp;O contract award fee calculations and such fee shall not be allocable to work conducted under this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(7) <em class="ph i">Organizational Conflict of Interest.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall conduct work under this clause in a manner that minimizes the appearance of conflicts of interest and avoids or mitigates actual conflicts of interest with the M&amp;O Contractor's functions under this M&amp;O contract. Accordingly, the M&amp;O Contractor shall develop an Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan (OCI Plan). The OCI Plan should address OCI issues that arise as a result of the M&amp;O Contractor taking a financial interest in ACT projects, especially in those cases where the M&amp;O Contractor retains rights in ACT IP. Said OCI Plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer for review and approval as soon as practicable after execution of the M&amp;O contract modification incorporating this clause into the M&amp;O contract. Unless provided otherwise by the Contracting Officer, no work on ACT agreements may commence before Contracting Officer approval of the OCI Plan. In addition to those elements expressly stated in the OCI Plan, the Department may condition any ACT transaction on such other mitigating conditions it determines are appropriate. The OCI Plan shall, at a minimum, include elements that address the following:
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Full Disclosure.</em> Before work can begin under an ACT transaction, all parties to ACT agreements must sign a DOE-approved certification that they have been fully informed about the availability of SPP agreements and CRADAs in addition to ACT. The certification at a minimum shall briefly describe SPP agreements, CRADAs and ACT, and will include the relative disposition of IP rights and the costs (including identification of any additional costs <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> insurance, and other compensation to the M&amp;O Contractor under ACT) for each type of agreement for the scope of work being proposed.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) <em class="ph i">Priority of Work.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall not give work under ACT any special attention or priority over other work under the DOE M&amp;O contract. Work under ACT shall be approved by the Contracting Officer and assigned the same priority relative to other work under the DOE M&amp;O contract that it would normally have if performed under a non-Federal SPP agreement. The Contracting Officer has discretion to determine the agency's priority of work, considering the M&amp;O Contractor's input.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) <em class="ph i">Participation by Contractor-affiliated sources:</em> If any source affiliated with the M&amp;O Contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the M&amp;O Contractor or its parent company) is a party to the ACT agreement, the M&amp;O Contractor shall include as necessary an addendum to the OCI Plan to address special circumstances not fully anticipated in the OCI Plan.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) <em class="ph i">Right of Inquiry for ACT IP Designation.</em> The Contracting Officer, upon request of DOE Patent Counsel may inquire into the M&amp;O Contractor's designation of any invention or data as arising under an ACT transaction. The M&amp;O Contractor is responsible for curing any defect identified in such inquiry, and if the M&amp;O Contractor cannot adequately justify the designation or cure the defect, then the parties to the ACT agreement may receive modified rights in the IP to the degree necessary to resolve the issues identified by the inquiry.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(8) <em class="ph i">Intellectual Property.</em> Disposition of intellectual property (IP) arising from work conducted under this clause shall be governed by Class Waiver W(C)-2011-013 (ACT Class Waiver), which is incorporated herein by reference.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) All Contractor ACT inventions shall be reported to DOE pursuant to the requirements of the [<em class="ph i">cite Patent Rights—M&amp;O contract, Nonprofit Organization or Small Business Firm Contractor</em>] clause of this M&amp;O contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) In reporting ACT inventions, the M&amp;O Contractor shall identify the ACT agreement under which the invention was made and specify the rights reserved by the Government pursuant to the ACT Class Waiver.

         <p class="p List2">(C) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(A) and (B) of this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government, the Department, and persons acting on their behalf for loss, damage, or destruction of Government property resulting from the fault or negligence of the M&amp;O Contractor. Such indemnification shall be subject to a liability limit of $2,000,000 (two million dollars) per year, or such greater liability limit approved by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer under the DOE contract. Above the applicable liability limit, the M&amp;O Contractor's responsibility to the Government for such loss, damage or destruction, shall be as set forth in the “Property” clause of this contract.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vi) <em class="ph i">Insurance.</em> Any cost of insurance to cover risks of the M&amp;O Contractor associated with ACT agreements is unallowable under this contract.

If the ACT agreement(s) cannot be novated, then the M&amp;O Contractor as a private sponsor shall be permitted to enter into a Non-Federal SPP agreement with the successor M&amp;O Contractor that will enable completion of the statement of work. Such agreements shall be entered into pursuant to DOE SPP policies. DOE shall make good faith efforts to incorporate the terms of the applicable ACT agreement.

The M&amp;O Contractor shall establish performance metric(s) to measure the time required to negotiate ACT agreements in a manner consistent with the time required to negotiate CRADAs and SPPs. The M&amp;O Contractor shall obtain from each entity engaged in ACT the entity's reason(s) for selecting ACT for performance of work under the M&amp;O contract. Also, the M&amp;O Contractor shall report the above identified data annually to the DOE Contracting Officer and in such a format that will serve to adequately inform DOE of the Contractor's activities under ACT while protecting any data not subject to disclosure under this M&amp;O contract. Such records shall be made available in accordance with the clauses of this M&amp;O contract pertaining to inspection, audit and examination of records.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor agrees that for limited rights data or restricted computer software or other technical, business or financial data in the form of recorded information which it receives from, or is given access to by, DOE or a third party, including a DOE Contractor or subcontractor, and for technical data or computer software it first produces under this Contract which is authorized to be marked by DOE, the Contractor shall treat such data in accordance with any restrictive legend contained thereon. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) In the performance of DOE contracted obligations, each contractor is required to manage scientific and technical information (STI) produced under the contract as a direct and integral part of the work and ensure its broad availability to all customer segments by making STI available to DOE's central STI coordinating office, the Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI). Requirements for all such reportable information to OSTI are in DOE Order 241.1, or successor version, whether it is publicly releasable, controlled unclassified information, or classified.

To the extent such authorization is granted, the Government reserves for itself and others acting on its behalf, a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license for Governmental purposes to publish, distribute, translate, duplicate, exhibit, and perform any such data copyrighted by the Contractor. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor agrees not to include in the technical data or computer software delivered under the contract any material copyrighted by the Contractor and not to knowingly include any material copyrighted by others without first granting or obtaining at no cost a license therein for the benefit of the Government of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. If the Contractor believes that such copyrighted material for which the license cannot be obtained must be included in the technical data or computer software to be delivered, rather than merely incorporated therein by reference, the Contractor shall obtain the written authorization of the contracting officer to include such material in the technical data or computer software prior to its delivery. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) If the Contractor has not been granted permission to copyright technical data or computer software first produced under the contract, and if the Government desires to obtain copyright in such data and computer software, the Patent Counsel may direct the Contractor to establish claim to copyright in such data or computer software and to assign such copyright to the Government or its designated assignee.

			Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the Contractor agrees to use in subcontracts in which technical data or computer software is expected to be produced or in subcontracts for supplies that contain a requirement for production or delivery of data in accordance with the policy and procedures the clause entitled, “Rights in Data-General” at 48 CFR 52.227-14 modified in accordance with 48 CFR 927.409 including alternates as appropriate with the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel, and the Contractor shall not acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software, except through the use of Alternate II or III, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. The clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be included in subcontracts in accordance with 48 CFR 927.409(d). In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated under its contract with DOE, the Contractor shall use the “rights in Data-Facilities” clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1.

 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) It is the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain from its subcontractors technical data and computer software and rights therein, on behalf of the Government, necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government with respect to such data. In the event of refusal by a subcontractor to accept a clause affording the Government such rights, the Contractor shall: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Promptly submit written notice to the contracting officer setting forth reasons or the subcontractor's refusal and other pertinent information which may expedite disposition of the matter, and

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Neither the Contractor nor higher-tier subcontractors shall use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use.

Such scientific and technical works may be recorded or fixed in any medium including but not limited to print, online, web, audio, video or other medium, and released or disseminated through any communication or distribution channel including but not limited to articles, reports, books, non-architectural drawings, repositories, videos, websites, workshops, or social media. When assertion of copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) on the data when such data are delivered to the Government as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			For data other than scientific and technical works under paragraph (d) of this clause and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The program under which it was funded;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Whether the data is subject to export control; and if so, which jurisdiction;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period; and
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined exclusively by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements; or
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The Contractor will obtain the advanced written approval of the Patent Counsel to assert copyright where data are determined to be in the following excepted categories:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Under export control restrictions;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Developed with Naval Reactors' funding;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Subject to disposition of data rights under treaties and international agreements. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified at DOE's Office of International Affairs (International Commitments—IEC).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Patent Counsel Review and Response to Contractor's Request.</em> The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 60 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor. If Patent Counsel grants permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in computer software, the permission automatically extends to subsequent minor versions (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> minor revisions, patches and bug fixes) having the same funding source, same name and substantially same functionality as the original computer software, and may be extended to subsequent major versions representing significant modifications of the program with the approval of Patent Counsel.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Permission for Contractor to Assert Copyright.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish, or make available to the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in accordance with OSTI guidelines at the time permission to assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Announcement information/metadata contained in the Software Announcement Notice 241.4;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) the source code and/or executable file for each software program; and
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Documentation, if any, which may consist of a user manual, sample test cases, or similar information, needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software (whether included on the software media itself or provided in a separate file or in paper format).
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Unless otherwise directed by the Patent Counsel, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish, or make available to OSTI in accordance with OSTI guidelines, a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Once the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor may begin to commercialize the copyrighted data by making copyrighted data available for licensing to third parties and by offering other types of distribution to third parties. During the period in which commercialization activities pertaining to the copyrighted data are continuing, or for a specified period of time prescribed by Patent Counsel in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. For all previously approved and current copyrighted data that the Contractor is actively commercializing, the Contractor may continue to commercialize in accordance with this paragraph.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright or at the end of the specified period as prescribed by Patent Counsel, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization activities for copyrighted data, the Contractor shall advise OSTI and Patent Counsel and, upon request, assign the copyright to the Government so that the Government can distribute the copyrighted data to the public. When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities, the Contractor will provide to OSTI the latest version of the copyrighted data (for example, source code, object code, minimal support documentation, drawings or updated manuals.) In addition, the Contractor will provide annually to Patent Counsel, if requested, a list of all copyrighted data that the Contractor has abandoned commercial licensing activity during that year.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) and (v) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office, or when submitted for publication. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be substantially similar to the following:

During the period of commercialization or such other time period specified by the Department of Energy, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Subsequent to that period the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data, apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(viii) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the period that Contractor is commercializing the data as provided for in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause. Before licensing under this paragraph, DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65—“Appeals.”
</p>
         <p class="p P">(ix) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(4) The following notice may be included in computer software prior to any publication or release and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this clause.

         <p class="p P">(5) A similar notice can be used for data, other than computer software, prior to any publication or release and prior to Contractor's obtaining permission of DOE Patent Counsel to assert copyright.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Open software source.</em> The Contractor may release computer software first produced by the Contractor in the performance of this contract under an open source software license. Such software shall hereinafter be referred to as open source software or OSS, subject to the following:
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(1) <em class="ph i">DOE Program notice for copyright assertion for OSS.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			The Contractor shall provide written notice (including relevant data such as, for example, the software disclosure form) to each DOE Program or Programs that have provided a substantial portion of the funding (funding source(s)) to develop the software that the Contractor intends to release as OSS unless the funding Program(s) has previously provided blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that Program or a specific DOE project stipulates the software to be released as OSS. If Program has neither consented nor objected to the assertion of copyright within two weeks of such written notification, the Contractor may assert copyright in the software. If notification of a funding DOE Program(s) is not practicable or DOE Program(s) has objected, the Contractor shall consult with Patent Counsel, which may provide approval. For software developed under a CRADA, Strategic Partnership Projects (SPP), User Facility Agreement, or Agreement for Commercializing Technology (ACT), authorization from the partner of such agreement shall be additionally obtained for OSS release unless such agreement has a provision providing for such copyright assertion.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) If the software is developed with funding from a federal government agency or agencies (funding source(s)) other than DOE, then authorization from all the funding agency(ies) shall be obtained for OSS release, if practicable. Such federal government agency(ies) may provide blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that agency(ies). However, OSS release of any one of such software shall be subject to approval by all other funding sources for the software, if any. If approval from such federal government agency(ies) is not practicable, the Patent Counsel may provide approval instead.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Assert copyright in the OSS.</em> Once the Contractor has met the program approval requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, copyright in the software to be distributed as OSS may be asserted by the Contractor, or, for OSS developed under a CRADA, User Facility Agreement, or SPP Agreement, either by the Contractor, CRADA Participant, User Facility User, or SPP Sponsor, as applicable, which precludes marking such OSS as protectable from public distribution.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Submit Software Announcement Notice 241.4 to OSTI.</em> The Contractor must submit Software Announcement Notice (AN) 241.4 (or the current notice as may be required by DOE) to OSTI. In the AN 241.4, the Contractor shall provide the unique URL (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> a persistent identifier) from which the software can be obtained so that OSTI can announce the availability of the OSS and the public has access via the URL.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Maintain OSS record.</em> The Contractor must maintain a record of all software distributed as OSS. Upon request of the Patent Counsel, the Contractor shall provide the necessary information regarding any or all OSS.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Provide public access to the OSS.</em> The Contractor shall ensure that the OSS is publicly accessible as open source via the Contractor's website, Open Source Bulletin Boards operated by third parties, DOE, or other standard industry methods.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Select an OSS license.</em> Each OSS will be distributed pursuant to an OSS license. The Contractor may choose among industry standard OSS licenses or create its own set of Contractor standard licenses. To assist the Contractor, the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property, may periodically issue guidance on OSS licenses. Each Contractor-created OSS license, must contain, at a minimum, the following provisions—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A disclaimer or equivalent that disclaims the Government's and Contractor's liability for licensees' and third parties' use of the software; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A grant of permission for licensee to distribute OSS containing the licensee's derivative works. This provision may allow the licensee and third parties to commercialize their derivative works or might request that the licensee's derivative works be forwarded to the Contractor for incorporation into future OSS versions.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) <em class="ph i">Relationship to other required clauses in the contract.</em> OSS distributed in accordance with this section shall not be subject to the requirements relating to indemnification of the Contractor or Federal Government, U.S. Competitiveness and U.S. Preference, as set forth in paragraphs (f) and (g) of the clause within this contract entitled Technology Transfer Mission (48 CFR 970.5227-3). The requirement for the Contractor to request permission to assert copyright for the purpose of engaging in licensing software for royalties, as set forth elsewhere in this clause, is not modified by this section.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) <em class="ph i">Government license.</em> For all OSS, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in data copyrighted in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this clause to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.

The Contractor shall not acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software, except through the use of Alternate II or III, respectively, without the prior approval of the Patent Counsel. The clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be included in subcontracts in accordance with 48 CFR 927.409(d). In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated under its contract with DOE, the Contractor shall use the “Rights in Data-Facilities” clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) It is the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain from its subcontractors technical data and computer software and rights therein, on behalf of the Government, necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government with respect to such data. In the event of refusal by a subcontractor to accept a clause affording the Government such rights, the Contractor shall:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Promptly submit written notice to the contracting officer setting forth reasons or the subcontractor's refusal and other pertinent information which may expedite disposition of the matter, and

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Give preference to business units located in the United States which agree that products or processes embodying Intellectual Property will be substantially manufactured or practiced in the United States and, in the case of any industrial organization or other person subject to the control of a foreign company or government, take into consideration whether or not such foreign government permits United States agencies, organizations, or other persons to enter into cooperative research and development agreements and licensing agreements. The Contractor, in considering these factors, may rely upon the information and same sources as referenced in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) of this clause;
</p>

The DOE shall cooperate with the Contractor in protecting such data.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Unless otherwise expressly approved by the contracting officer in advance for a specific CRADA, the Contractor agrees, at the request of the contracting officer, to transmit such data to other DOE facilities for use by DOE or its Contractors by or on behalf of the Government. When data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause is so transferred, the Contractor shall clearly mark the data with a legend setting out the restrictions against private use and further dissemination, along with the expiration date of such restrictions.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A final technical report, upon completion of a CRADA, shall be provided to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information; reports marked as Protected CRADA Information will not be released to the public for a period in accordance with the terms of the CRADA.

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Rights to inventions made under agreements other than funding agreements with third parties shall be governed by the appropriate provisions incorporated, with DOE approval, in such agreements, and the provisions in such agreements take precedence over any disposition of rights contained in this Contract.

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			<em class="ph i">Subject invention disclosure.</em> The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Patent Counsel within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written or electronic report and shall identify the contract or any other agreement under which the invention was made and the inventor(s) and all sources of funding by Budget and Resources (B&amp;R) code for the invention. The funding program may require other invention identifiers such as related award numbers or funding opportunity announcement numbers. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted or made available for publication at the time of disclosure. The disclosure shall identify if the invention falls within an exceptional circumstance field.

In addition, after disclosure to the Patent Counsel, the Contractor will notify the agency of any accepted manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the contractor that is 60 days prior to the end of the Statutory Period. The Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information concerning any nonelectable subject invention such as an exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention related to a treaty or international agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) <em class="ph i">Election by the Contractor.</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency within two years of disclosure to the Federal agency.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Filing of patent applications by the Contractor.</em> The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, or prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding first filed patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
</p>

Contractor's Invention Identification Procedures under paragraph (f)(5) of this clause should address timely disclosure of inventions, consider whether review is required, and if so, facilitate such review by Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters prior to disclosure of publications in order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interest of DOE or the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(6) <em class="ph i">Reporting to DOE and Approvals.</em> Whenever possible in this paragraph (c), the Government electronic reporting system (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> iEdison or similar system) shall be used for reporting and approvals.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c), but prior to its receipt of the written request of the DOE, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.
</p>

When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) <em class="ph i">Revocation or modification of a Contractor license.</em> The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781. This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license.</em> Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(3) <em class="ph i">Notification of discontinuation of patent protection.</em> The contractor will notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to file a patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 60 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.

For subcontracts subject to a patent waiver granted by DOE Patent Counsel, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause. For subcontracts subject to exceptional circumstances, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause which may require the use of Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-13 Patent Rights—Acquisition by the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(4) <em class="ph i">DOE and subcontractor contract.</em> With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(6) <em class="ph i">Notification of award of subcontract.</em> Upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(7) <em class="ph i">Identification of subcontractor subject inventions.</em> If the Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention.

In addition, the Contractor shall provide data to DOE for the annual data call for the Department of Commerce report that includes the number of patent applications filed, the number of patents issued, licensing activity, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Preference for United States Industry.</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">March-in Rights.</em> The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right under 35 U.S.C. 203 and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself under applicable law stated above.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Small business firm licensees.</em> It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business firm applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this paragraph (k)(2).

In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner, <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change.

The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:

         <p class="p List2">(A) The Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible; and

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Consistent with 48 CFR 970.5227-3(f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, for all subject inventions under the S&amp;E DEC, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner, <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contactor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (t)(1). The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Waivers.</em> The Contractor (or any entity subject to this paragraph) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause. Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that 
				</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) 
			the Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible and (B) a waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Final determination of breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause.</em> If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions subject to the breach to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer &amp; Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) <em class="ph i">License, Assignment, or Transfer.</em> Pursuant to Contractor's agreement in paragraph (t)(1) of this clause to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause: any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (t)(1) of this clause suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) <em class="ph i">Compensation.</em> For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, unless DOE grants a license through a separately agreed upon licensing agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(u) <em class="ph i">Publication.</em> The Contractor shall receive approval from Patent Counsel prior to releasing or publishing information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, to ensure such release or publication does not adversely affect the patent rights of DOE or the Contractor. At the discretion of the Patent Counsel, authority to review publications prior to release may be delegated to the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(v) <em class="ph i">Termination of contractor's advance class waiver.</em> If a request by the Contractor for an advance class waiver pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause contains false material statements or fails to disclose material facts, and DOE relies on the false statements or omissions in granting the Contractor's request, the waiver or grant of any Government rights (in whole or in part) to the subject invention(s) may be terminated at the discretion of the Secretary of Energy or designee. Prior to termination, DOE shall provide the Contractor with written notification of the termination, including a statement of facts in support of the termination, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days, or a longer period authorized by the Secretary of Energy or designee for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor, to show cause for not terminating the waiver or grant. Any termination of an advance class waiver or a determination of greater rights is subject to the Contractor's license as provided for in paragraph (f) of this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(w) <em class="ph i">Unauthorized Access.</em> The contractor will protect all invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information from unauthorized access and disclosure using at least commonly available techniques and practices. In the event that the Contractor becomes aware of unauthorized access to invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel within 7 days.

			The Contractor shall provide for—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Periodic post-award audit—or a sufficient amount of audit work (that the Contractor's auditor or the Contracting Officer agrees is sufficient)—to provide reasonable assurance that all claimed subcontract costs are allowable for: flexibly priced subcontracts at all tiers; and the flexibly priced elements in any subcontracts at all tiers (“flexibly priced” subcontracts and elements include Cost-Reimbursement subcontracts, Time-and-Materials subcontracts, cost-reimbursement elements in Fixed-Priced contracts, etc.); and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Audits, where necessary, to provide a valid basis for pre-award or cost or price analysis.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) Responsibility for determining the costs allowable under each cost-reimbursement subcontract remains with the contractor or next higher-tier subcontractor. The Contractor shall provide, in appropriate cases, for the timely joint involvement of the Contractor and the DOE Contracting Officer in resolution of subcontract cost allowability. In no case, however, shall the Contractor's subcontract audit arrangements preclude the Contracting Officer's determination of the allowability or unallowability of the subcontract costs the Contractor claims for reimbursement.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Where audits of subcontractors at any tier are required, the Contractor shall consult with the DOE Contracting Officer on the best approach for obtaining an audit; this may involve employing external auditors. The Contractor shall interact with the cognizant Federal agency in a manner appropriate to the magnitude and nature of the subcontracted work. In no case, however, shall subcontractor auditing arrangements preclude determination by the DOE Contracting Officer of the allowability or unallowability of subcontractor costs claimed for reimbursement by the Contractor.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Allowable costs for cost reimbursable subcontracts are to be determined in accordance with the cost principles of 48 CFR part 31, appropriate for the type of organization to which the subcontract is to be awarded, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931. Allowable costs in the purchase or transfer from contractor-affiliated sources shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3 and 31.205-26(e).

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contractor shall require performance bonds in amounts as set forth in 48 CFR 28.102-2(b) for all fixed-priced and unit-priced construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000. The Contractor shall consider the use of performance bonds in fixed-price non-construction subcontracts, where appropriate.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost reimbursement construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000, a payment bond shall be obtained on Standard Form 25A modified to name the Contractor as well as the United States of America as obligees. The amounts shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction subcontracts greater than $35,000, but not greater than $150,000, the Contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR 28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the liability of any one surety exceed the maximum sum for which it is qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of acceptable corporate sureties.




</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Buy American.</em> The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of the Buy American Act as reflected in 48 CFR 52.225-1 and 48 CFR 52.225-9. The Contractor shall forward determinations of non-availability of individual items to the DOE Contracting Officer for approval. Items in excess of $500,000 require the prior concurrence of the Head of Contracting Activity. If, however, the Contractor has an approved purchasing system, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize the Contractor to make determinations of non-availability for individual items valued at $500,000 or less.

         <p class="p List3">(i)

This prohibition does not preclude the award of a “turnkey” subcontract so long as the subcontractor assumes all liability for defects in design and construction and consequential damages.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor shall not award both a cost-reimbursement subcontract and a fixed-price subcontract for construction or architect-engineer services or any combination thereof to the same firm where those subcontracts will be performed at the same site.

Subcontracts shall be in the name of the Contractor, and shall not bind or purport to bind the Government.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In the event that the Contractor is determined liable for the loss, destruction or damage to Government property in accordance with this clause, the Contractor's compensation to the Government shall be determined as follows:
