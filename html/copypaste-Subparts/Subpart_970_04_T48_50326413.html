         <p class="p List1">(b) Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities, provides for the organization and control of United States foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities. DOE has established a counterintelligence program subject to this Executive Order which is described in DOE Order 475.1, Counterintelligence Program, or its successor. All DOE elements, including management and operating contractors and other contractors managing DOE-owned facilities which require access authorizations, should undertake the necessary precautions to ensure that DOE and covered Contractor personnel, programs and resources are properly protected from foreign intelligence threats and activities.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) For DOE management and operating contracts and other contracts designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts,” implements the requirements of section 234B of the Atomic Energy Act (see 904.402(c)(1)) for the use of a contract clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fee or amount paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any rule, regulation, or order relating to the safeguarding or security of Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause, in part, provides for reductions in the amount of fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by the contractor for performance failures relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.

For informational purposes, the contracting officer may append the contract with a list of applicable laws or regulations (see 970.5204-2, Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives, paragraph (a)). 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The Department of Energy Directives System is a system of instructions, including orders, notices, manuals, guides, and standards, for Departmental elements. In certain circumstances, requirements contained in these directives may apply to a contractor through operation of a contract clause. Program and requirements personnel are responsible for identifying requirements in the Directives Program which are applicable to a contract, and for developing a list of applicable requirements and providing it to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Where directives requirements are established using either the Standards/Requirements Identification Process or the Work Smart Standards Process, the applicable process should also be used to establish the environment, safety, and health portion of the list identified in paragraph (b) of this section. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Environmental, safety, and health (ES&amp;H) requirements appropriate for work conducted under a management and operating contract may be determined by a DOE approved process to evaluate the work and the associated hazards, and identify an appropriately tailored set of standards, practices, and controls, such as a tailoring process included in a DOE approved Safety Management System implemented under 970.5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution. When such a process is used, the contracting officer shall ensure that the set of tailored requirements, as approved by DOE pursuant to the process, is incorporated into the list identified in paragraph (b) of this section. These requirements shall supersede, in whole or in part, the contractual environmental, safety, and health requirements previously made applicable to the contract by List B. If the tailored set of requirements identifies an alternative requirement which varies from an ES&amp;H requirement of an otherwise applicable law or regulation, the contractor must request an exemption or other appropriate regulatory relief that may be specified in the governing regulation.
