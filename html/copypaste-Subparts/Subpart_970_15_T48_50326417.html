         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-2 Fee policy.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) DOE management and operating contractors may be paid a fee in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) There are three basic principles underlying the Department's fee policy: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of available fee should reflect the financial risk assumed by the contractor. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) It is the policy of the Department, when work elements cannot be fixed price, incentive fees (including award fees) tied to objective measures should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When work elements cannot be fixed price and award fees are employed, they should be tied to either objective or subjective measures. Each measure should, to the maximum extent appropriate, be directly tied to a specific portion of the fee pool. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Fee objectives and amounts are to be determined for each contract. Standard fees or across-the-board fee agreements will not be used or made. Due to the nature of funding management and operating contracts, it is anticipated that fee shall be established in accordance with the annual funding cycle; however, with the prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, a longer period may be used where necessary to incentivize performance objectives that span funding cycles or to optimize cost reduction efforts. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Annual fee amounts shall be established in accordance with this subsection. Annual amounts shall not exceed maximum amounts derived from the appropriate fee schedule (and Classification Factor, if applicable) unless approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. In no event shall any fee exceed statutory limits imposed by 41 U.S.C. 254(b). 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(e)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Contracting Officers shall include negative fee incentives in contracts when appropriate. A negative fee incentive is one in which the contractor will not be paid the full target fee amount when the actual performance level falls below the target level established in the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Negative fee incentives may only be used when -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A target level of performance can be established, which the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance is not acceptable. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Prior to the issuance of a competitive solicitation or the initiation of negotiations for an extension of an existing contract, the HCA shall coordinate the maximum available fee, as allowed by 970.1504-1-1, and the fee amount targeted for negotiation, if less, with the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. Solicitations shall identify maximum available fee under the contract and may invite offerors to propose fee less than the maximum available. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) When a contract subject to this subsection requires a contractor to use its own facilities or equipment, or other resources to make its own cost investment for contract performance, (e.g., when there is no letter-of-credit financing) consideration may be given, subject to approval by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, to increasing the total available fee amount above that otherwise provided by this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) Multiple fee arrangements should be used in accordance with 970.1504-1-4. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(i)(1) In addition to other performance requirements specified in the contract, DOE management and operating contractors and other contractors designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, are subject to performance requirements relating to: environment, safety, and health (ES&amp;H), including worker safety and health (WS&amp;H); and safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. Performance requirements relating to ES&amp;H will be set forth in the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including a DOE approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), or similar document. As applicable, performance requirements relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information will be set forth in the clauses of the contract entitled “Security” and “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions that prescribe requirements for the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(2) If the contractor does not meet the performance requirements of the contract relating to ES&amp;H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts.” 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(3) The clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts,” provides for reductions of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under the contract depending upon the severity of the contractor's performance failure relating to ES&amp;H requirements and, if applicable, relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a potential reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are included in the clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(4) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the cognizant Program Secretarial Officer 
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or profit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts;” and 
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee or profit is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise be subject to a reduction.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-3 Special considerations: Laboratory management and operation.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) For the management and operation of a laboratory, the contracting officer shall consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations should include: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The nature and extent of financial or other liability or risk assumed or to be assumed under the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally accepted accounting methods) that are utilized to fund the performance of work related to the DOE contracted effort; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Facilities capital or capital equipment acquisition plans; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Other funding needs, to include contingency funding, working capital funding, and provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and necessary; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The utility of fee as a performance incentive; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The need for fee to attract qualified contractors, organizations, and institutions.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall determine the amount of fee in accordance with this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Costs incurred in the operation of a laboratory that are allowable and allocable under the cost principles (i.e., commercial using 48 CFR 31.2, nonprofit using OMB Circular A-122, or university-affiliated using OMB Circular A-21), regulations (including subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_970_31_T48_503264118.html#Subpart_970_31_T48_503264118">970.31</a>), or statutes applicable to the operating contractor should be classified as direct or indirect (overhead or G&amp;A) charges to the contract and not included as proposed fee. Exceptions must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Except as specified in 970.1504-1-3(c)(3), the maximum total amount of fee shall be calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9, as appropriate. The total amount of fee under any laboratory management and operating contract or other designated contract shall not exceed, and may be significantly less than, the result of that calculation. In determining the total amount of fee, the contracting officer shall consider the evaluation of the factors in paragraph (a) of this subsection as well as any benefits the laboratory operator will receive due to its tax status. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall establish the type of fee arrangement in accordance with this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of fee may be established as total available fee with a base fee portion and a performance fee portion. Base fee, if any, shall be an amount in recognition of the risk of financial liability assumed by the contractor and shall not exceed the cost risk associated with those liabilities or the amount calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. The total available fee, excepting any base fee, shall normally be associated with performance at or above the target level of performance as defined by the contract. If performance in either of the two general work categories appropriate for laboratories (science/technology and support) is rated at less than the target level of performance, the total amount of the available fee shall be subject to downward adjustment. Such downward adjustment shall be subject to the terms of the clause at 970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives - Facility Management Contracts, if contained in the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The amount of fee may be established as a fixed fee in recognition of the risk of financial liability to be assumed by the contractor, with such fixed fee amount not exceeding the cost risk associated with the liabilities assumed or the amount of fee calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the fixed fee or total available fee exceeds 75% of the fee that would be calculated per 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9; or if a fee arrangement other than one of those set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this subsection is considered appropriate, the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, shall be obtained prior to its use. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Fee, if any, as well as the type of fee arrangement, will normally be established for the life of the contract. It will be established at time of award, as part of the extend/compete decision, at the time of option exercise, or at such other time as the parties can mutually reach agreement, e.g., negotiations. Such agreement shall require the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Fee established for longer than one year shall be subject to adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than ±10% or a lessor amount if appropriate) to the budget or work scope. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Retained earnings (reserves) shall be identified and a plan for their use and disposition developed. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) The use of retained earnings as a result of performance of laboratory management and operation may be restricted if the operator is an educational institution.

      <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title7">
         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-4 Types of contracts and fee arrangements.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Contract types and fee arrangements suitable for management and operating contracts may include cost, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed-price or any combination thereof (see 48 CFR subpart 16.1). In accordance with 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2(b)(1), the fee arrangement chosen for each work element should reflect the financial risk for project failure that contractors are willing to accept. Contracting officials shall structure each contract and the elements of the work in such a manner that the risk is manageable and, therefore, assumable by the contractor. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Consistent with the concept of a performance-based management contract, those contract types which incentivize performance and cost control are preferred over a cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangement. Accordingly, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract in instances other than those set forth in 970.1504-1-3(c)(2) may only be used when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) A cost-plus-award-fee contract is generally the appropriate contract type for a management and operating contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Where work cannot be adequately defined to the point that a fixed price contract is acceptable, the attainment of acquisition objectives generally will be enhanced by using a cost-plus-award-fee contract or other incentive fee arrangement to effectively motivate the contractor to superior performance and to provide the Department with flexibility to evaluate actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The construct of fee for a cost-plus-award-fee management and operating contract is that total available fee will equal a base fee amount and a performance fee amount. The total available fee amount including the performance fee amount the contractor may earn, in whole or in part during performance, shall be established annually (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee), in an amount sufficient to motivate performance excellence. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) However, consistent with concepts of performance-based contracting, it is Departmental policy to place fee at risk based on performance. Accordingly, a base fee amount will be available only when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, except as permitted in 970.1504-1-3(c)(1). Any base fee amount shall be fixed, expressed as a percent of the total available fee at inception of the contract, and shall not exceed that percent during the life of the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The performance fee amount may consist of an objective fee component and a subjective fee component. Objective performance measures, when appropriately applied, provide greater incentives for superior performance than do subjective performance measures and should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. Subjective measures should be used when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule for particular work elements. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Consistent with performance-based contracting concepts, performance objectives and measures related to performance fee should be as clearly defined as possible and, where feasible, expressed in terms of desired performance results or outcomes. Specific measures for determining performance achievement should be used. The contract should identify the amount and allocation of fee to each performance result or outcome. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Because the nature and complexity of the work performed under a management and operating contract may be varied, opportunities may exist to utilize multiple contract types and fee arrangements. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection and 48 CFR subpart 16.1, the contracting officer should apply that contract type or fee arrangement most appropriate to the work component. However, multiple contract types or fee arrangements -  
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Must conform to the requirements of 48 CFR part 915 and 48 CFR parts 15 and 16, and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where appropriate to the type, must be supported by -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Negotiated costs subject to the requirements of the Truth in Negotiations Act, 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A pre-negotiation memorandum, and 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A plan describing how each contract type or fee arrangement will be administered. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Cost reduction incentives are addressed in the clause at 970.5215-4, Cost Reduction. This clause provides for incentives for quantifiable cost reductions associated with contractor proposed changes to a design, process, or method that has an established cost, technical, and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. The clause is to be included in management and operating contracts as appropriate. Proposed changes must be: Initiated by the contractor, innovative, applied to a specific project or program, and not otherwise included in an incentive under the contract. Such cost reduction incentives do not constitute fee and are not subject to statutory or regulatory fee limitations; however, they are subject to all appropriate requirements set forth in this subpart. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) Operations and field offices shall take the lead in developing and implementing the most appropriate pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive for the requirements. Pricing arrangements which provide incentives for performance and cost control are preferred over those that do not. The operations and field offices are to ensure that the necessary resources and infrastructure exist within both the contractor's and government's organizations to prepare, evaluate, and administer the pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive prior to its implementation.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.1504-1</span>-5 General considerations and techniques for determining fixed fees.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The Department's fee policy recognizes that fee is remuneration to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources, the use of their resources (including capital resources), and, as appropriate, their assumption of the risk that some incurred costs (operating and capital) may not be reimbursed. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Use of a purely cost-based structured approach for determining fee objectives and amounts for DOE management and operating contracts is inappropriate considering the limited level of contractor cost, capital goods, and operating capital outlays for performance of such contracts. Instead of being solely cost-based, the desirable approach calls for a structure that allows evaluation of the following eight significant factors, as outlined in order of importance, and the assignment of appropriate fee values (subject to the limitations on fixed fee in 970.1504-1-6) -  
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work accomplishment and experience; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Management risk relating to performance, including -  
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Composite risk and complexity of principal work tasks required to do the job; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Labor intensity of the job; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Special control problems; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources, as compared to the nature and degree of subcontracting and the relative complexity of subcontracted efforts, subcontractor management and integration; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Size and operation (number of locations, plants, differing operations, etc.); 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Influence of alternative investment opportunities available to the contractor (i.e., the extent to which undertaking a task for the Government displaces a contractor's opportunity to make a profit with the same staff and equipment in some other field of activity); 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining experience and knowledge of how to do something, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or from having the opportunity to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small and minority business subcontracting, energy conservation, etc. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The total fee objective for a particular annual fixed fee negotiation is established by evaluating the factors in this subsection, assigning fee values to them, and totaling the resulting amounts (subject to limitations on total fixed fee in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-6).

         <p class="p List1">(a) The fee base is an estimate of necessary allowable costs, with some exclusions. It is used in the fee schedules to determine the maximum annual fee for a fixed fee contract. That portion of the fee base that represents the cost of the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, shall be exclusive of the cost of source and special nuclear materials; estimated costs of land, buildings and facilities whether to be leased, purchased or constructed; depreciation of Government facilities; and any estimate of effort for which a separate fee is to be negotiated. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Such portion of the fee base, in addition to the adjustments in paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall exclude -  
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Any part of the estimated cost of capital equipment (other than special equipment) which the contractor procures by subcontract or other similar costs which is of such magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of the contractor; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) At least 20% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Up to 100% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements if they are of a magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of the contractor; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Special equipment as defined in 970.1504-1-8; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Estimated cost of Government-furnished property, services and equipment; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) All estimates of costs not directly incurred by or reimbursed to the operating contractor; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Estimates of home office or corporate general and administrative expenses that shall be reimbursed through the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Estimates of any independent research and development cost or bid and proposal expenses that may be approved under the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(9) Any cost of work funded with uncosted balances previously included in a fee base of this or any other contract performed by the contractor; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(10) Cost of rework attributable to the contractor; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(11) State taxes. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In calculating the annual fee amounts associated with the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, the fee base is to be allocated to the category reflecting the work to be performed and the appropriate fee schedule utilized. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The portion of the fee base associated with the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed and the associated schedules in this part are not intended to reflect the portion of the fee base or related compensation for unusual architect-engineer, construction services, or special equipment provided by the management and operating contractor. Architect-engineer and construction services are normally covered by special agreements based on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction contracts. Fees paid for such services shall be calculated using the provisions of 915.404-4-71-5 relating to architect-engineer or construction fees and shall be in addition to the operating fees calculated for the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed. Special equipment purchases shall be addressed in accordance with the provisions of 970.1504-1-8 relating to special equipment. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) No schedule set forth in 915.404-4-71-5 or 970.1504-1-6 shall be used more than once in the determination of the fee amount for an annual period, unless prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, is obtained.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Special equipment is sometimes procured in conjunction with management and operating contracts. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment which shall not exceed the maximum fee allowable as established using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) In determining appropriate fees, factors such as complexity of equipment, ratio of procurement transactions to volume of equipment to be purchased and completeness of services should be considered. Where possible, the reasonableness of the fees should be checked by their relationship to actual costs of comparable procurement services. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) For purposes of this subsection, special equipment is equipment for which the purchase price is of such a magnitude compared to the cost of installation as to distort the amount of technical direction and management effort required of the contractor. Special equipment is of a nature that requires less management attention. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). The determination of specific items of equipment in this category requires application of judgment and careful study of the circumstances involved in each project. This category of equipment would generally include: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Major items of prefabricated process or research equipment; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Major items of preassembled equipment such as packaged boilers, generators, machine tools, and large electrical equipment. In some cases, it would also include special apparatus or devices such as reactor vessels and reactor charging machines.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) When a management and operating contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis, several special considerations are appropriate. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) All annual performance incentives identified under these contracts are funded from the annual total available fee, which consists of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (which typically will consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both). 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The annual total available fee for the contract shall equal the product of the fee(s) that would have been calculated for an annual fixed fee contract and the classification factor(s) most appropriate for the facility/task. If more than one fee schedule is applicable to the contract, the annual total available fee shall be the sum of the available fees derived proportionately from each fee schedule; consideration of significant factors applicable to each fee schedule; and application of a Classification Factor(s) most appropriate for the work.
