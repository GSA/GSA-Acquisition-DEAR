         <p class="p List1">(a) Management and operating contractors shall develop and maintain systems of management and quality control to discourage waste, fraud and abuse; and to ensure that components, products, and services that are provided to the Department of Energy (DOE) satisfy the contractor's obligations under the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) As a part of the required overall management structure, the contractor must maintain management control systems which, in compliance with the requirements of the clause at 970.5203-1— 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Are documented and satisfactory to DOE; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Ensure that all levels of management are accountable for effective management systems and internal controls within their areas of assigned responsibility; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Cover both programmatic and administrative functions; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are safeguarded against theft, fraud, waste, and unauthorized use; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Promote efficient and effective operations; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Ensure that all obligations and costs incurred are in compliance with the intended purposes and the terms and conditions of the contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Properly record, manage, and report all revenues, expenditures, transactions and assets; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Maintain financial, statistical and other reports necessary to maintain accurate, reliable, and timely accountability and management controls; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(9) Are periodically reviewed to ensure that the systems provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system are being accomplished and that these controls are working effectively. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Management and operating contractors shall also develop and maintain a baseline program of quality assurance that will implement documented performance and quality standards, and management controls and assessment techniques to ensure components, services, and products meet DOE's, design criteria and other governing and applicable specifications. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) DOE expects all its contractors to seek to identify improvements in any aspect of performance. Management and operating contracts are very large and complex; therefore, the opportunities to identify changes in performance that will increase the effectiveness or efficiency of contract performance are more prevalent than under other contracts. The clause at 970.5203-2 requires DOE management and operating contractors to affirmatively seek to identify, evaluate, and institute, where appropriate, processes that will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of any aspect of contract performance. It further requires the contractor to communicate any such improvements to DOE, other management and operating contractors, and DOE major facilities contractors. The contractor is required to participate in efforts by those contractors to address common problems or the institution of improvements. It allows the contractor to enlist the aid of the DOE contracting officer where necessary to institute or communicate the improvements. The obligations under the clause in no way affect the contractor's obligations under other provisions of the contract to notify or acquire the approval of the contracting officer.

         <p class="p Runin List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Basic principles.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			M&amp;O contracts are typically cost-reimbursement type contracts with incentive fees. An M&amp;O contract, however, may be of any contract type or combination of types (for example, firm-fixed-price, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, multiple-incentive, etc.). Regardless of contract type, an M&amp;O contract may contain work elements using different incentives.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract shall only be used if approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) or designee. The fee for a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract may not exceed the limits at FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) A base fee amount may only be used if approved in advance by the SPE or designee.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Incentive fees allocated to evaluation periods under cost-reimbursement type contracts should, to the greatest extent appropriate, be tied to a specific portion of the maximum total available fee.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The maximum total available fee amount may not exceed the fee derived from this subsection unless approved in advance by the SPE or designee. A request to allow a higher fee must be in writing and must clearly explain why the situation merits consideration.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Typically, only a situation where either unusually difficult objective performance incentives would be used or where successful performance would provide extraordinary value would merit consideration.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When a contract requires a contractor to use its own facilities, equipment, or other resources for contract performance (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> when there is no letter-of-credit financing), consideration may be given, subject to approval by the SPE or designee, to allowing a maximum total available fee amount above the amount calculated by this subsection.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Each M&amp;O contract must set forth in the contract (or in a Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan (PEMP) or similar document) the methods that will be used to rate the contractor's performance and to determine the fee the contractor's performance will earn. The DOE Contracting Officer must ensure all important areas of contract performance are specified in the contract or in a PEMP (or similar document), even if such areas are not assigned a specific portion of the maximum total available fee the contractor might earn.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) An M&amp;O contract is an “incentive contract” as that term is used in FAR subpart 16.4. FAR subpart 16.4 prohibits the use in a contract of other than cost incentives without also providing a cost incentive (or constraint).
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Award fee not earned during the award fee cycle shall not be carried over to any future award fee cycle. Consequently—
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) When the award fee cycle consists of one evaluation period, unearned award fee amounts may not be carried over from one evaluation period to the next.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) When the award fee cycle consists of two or more evaluation periods, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, unearned award fee amounts may be carried over from one evaluation period to the next, so long as the periods are within the same award fee cycle.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) C<em class="ph i">oordination requirements.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Before issuing a competitive solicitation, the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) must coordinate the greatest maximum total available fee amount the HCA will accept with the SPE or designee. A competitive solicitation must identify the greatest maximum total available fee amount the Government will accept and may invite offerors to propose a lower fee amount.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) Before beginning to negotiate an extension to an existing contract, the HCA must coordinate the greatest maximum total available fee amount the HCA will accept, and the maximum total available fee amount targeted for negotiation with the SPE or designee.

         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">General.</em> Determining the fee of an M&amp;O contract requires considering the:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Magnitude of the effort;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Type of the effort;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Nature, difficulty, complexity, and importance of the work; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Specific circumstances of the procurement.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Maximum total available fee amount for the contract, annual fee bases, and allocation of the maximum total available fee amount.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Determining the maximum total available fee amount of an M&amp;O contract, which is based upon the fee base (among other things) in each of the one-year periods of the M&amp;O contract, is a separate action from allocating that amount to the evaluation periods of the contract, which is based upon what best motivates the M&amp;O contractor's superior performance. The Government's objective is to allocate incentives in a manner that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The maximum total available fee amount in an M&amp;O contract is the sum of the maximum total available fee amounts in the contract's one-year periods. (See 970.1504-104 for a complete explanation of the calculation of the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period and an example.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period is based on the fee base for that one-year period. The fee base is an estimate of the allowable costs (with some exclusions) for that one-year period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The fee base is a basic component of the fee schedules, which link the fee base to fee. A fundamental aspect of fee calculations is the amount of the fee base and the amount of fee in the fee schedules are annual amounts. Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period starts with determining the fee base for the one-year period. Consequently, a contract's maximum total available fee amount is based on the contract's one-year periods and their fee bases.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Usually (but not necessarily) once the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period is calculated, it is allocated (that is, made available to be earned by the M&amp;O contractor) to the same one-year period. Additionally, when a maximum total available fee amount is established for longer than a year, it is subject to adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than plus or minus ten percent or a lesser percent if appropriate) to the budget or work scope.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) In summary, while the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period is based on the fee base for the one-year period, the evaluation period in which the contractor may earn all, or part of that fee need not be the same one-year period or even a single evaluation period. Usually, the length of an evaluation period is one year, mirroring the one-year period used in the calculation of the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period. In fact, the SPE's or designee's approval is required to do otherwise. Nonetheless, the Government's objective is to allocate incentives in a manner that will provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. Consequently, there may be occasions where after calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a year, part or all of it should be allocated to a subsequent one-year evaluation period, an evaluation period of greater than a year, or to several evaluation periods.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Before each year (or other appropriate period), at any time before the year (or period), including as early as the time of contract award, the Contracting Officer and M&amp;O contractor will enter negotiations to establish the requirements for the year (or other appropriate period), including evaluation areas, individual requirements, and the maximum total available fee that the contractor can earn for its performance. If the parties cannot agree, the Contracting Officer will unilaterally establish the requirements and the maximum total available fee. The maximum total available fee allocated to an evaluation period must be apportioned among a base fee amount (which is usually zero) and a performance fee amount. The performance fee amount may consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both. Both performance fee components are “incentives” per FAR subpart 16.4 and both are performance based. The performance fee must be tied to objective measures to the maximum extent appropriate. Performance incentive fee is preferable to performance award fee because it uses objective performance requirements rather than subjective performance requirements. Performance fee that is award fee may be used when: objective measures are not feasible (that is, when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule); and the likelihood of meeting acquisition objectives will be enhanced by using incentives that effectively motivate the contactor toward exceptional performance and provide the Government with the flexibility to evaluate both actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) Within the maximum total available fee, Contracting Officer may include a type of incentive fee component, often labeled “performance based incentive (PBI),” that includes a target fee for a target level of performance. Each PBI must be tied to a specific portion of the total available fee pool. PBIs may only be used when—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A target level of performance can be established that the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Factors likely to impede the target performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance is not acceptable.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Determining the maximum total available fee for each one-year period of the contract.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Determining the maximum total available fee for each one-year period of the contract is a function of the:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Magnitude of the effort (reflected by the total fee base for the year; see 970.1504-105);
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Type of the effort (reflected by the allocation of the total fee base to the three fee schedules—production, research and development, and environmental restoration; see 970.1504-106);
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Nature, difficulty, complexity, and importance of the work (reflected by the choice of classification factors; see 970.1504-107); and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Specific circumstances of the procurement (reflected by the appropriate percentages derived from considering significant factors; see 970.1504-108).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Calculating the maximum total available fee for a one-year period entails determining the total fee base for the year, allocating it to the fee schedules based on the type of effort, using the fee schedules to determine a fee subtotal for each type of effort, multiplying those fee subtotals by classification factors, multiplying the resulting products by appropriate percentages, and summing those products. (See 970.1504-104 for a complete explanation and an example.)

         <p class="p Runin List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Conditional payment of fee, profit, and other incentives.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			In addition to other performance requirements specified in their contracts, M&amp;O contractors are subject to performance requirements relating to: environment, safety, and health (ES&amp;H), including worker safety and health (WS&amp;H) and safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. Performance requirements relating to ES&amp;H will be set forth in the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including a DOE-approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), or similar document. Performance requirements relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information will be set forth in the clauses of the contract at 952.204-2, “Security Requirements,” and 970.5204-2, “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions that prescribe requirements for the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. (If the contract does not include the clause at 952.204-2, “Security Requirements,” the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information requirements of the clause at 970.5215-3, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” do not apply.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the contractor does not meet the performance requirements of the contract relating to ES&amp;H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives may be unilaterally reduced by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 970.5215-3, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts.”
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The clause at 970.5215-3, entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” provides for reductions of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives under the contract depending upon the severity of the contractor's performance failure relating to ES&amp;H requirements, and relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives, the Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are included in the clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The Contracting Officer must obtain the concurrence of the cognizant Program Secretarial Officer—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Prior to effecting any reduction; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Prior to determining that a reduction is not warranted for a particular performance failure or a group of performance failures.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The Contracting Officer must coordinate with the Office of Enforcement within the Office of Enterprise Assessments (or with any designated successor office) before pursuing a contract fee reduction in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any DOE regulation relating to worker safety and health concerns. See 970.2303-2.

         <p class="p List1">(a) The maximum total available fee amount for a contract is the sum of the maximum total available fee amounts of the contract's one-year periods. The maximum total available fee amount in a one-year period is based on the fee base of the one-year period. Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period requires considering the: magnitude of the effort (reflected by the total fee base for the year); type of effort (reflected by the allocation of the total fee base to the three fee schedules); nature, difficulty, complexity, and importance of the work (reflected by the choice of classification factors); and specific circumstances of the procurement (reflected by the appropriate percentages derived from considering significant factors).

         <p class="p List1">(d) In summary, the maximum total available fee amount for a contract is the sum of the maximum total available fee amounts of the contract's one-year periods. Calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period entails determining the total fee base, allocating it to the fee schedules, using the fee schedules to determine fee subtotals, multiplying the fee subtotals by classification factors, multiplying the resulting products by appropriate percentages, and summing those products. (Allocating the amount of maximum total available fee for a one-year period to an evaluation period or periods is a separate action.)

         <p class="p List1">(a) The total fee base for a one-year period (see step 1 located at 970.1504-104(b)(1)) is an estimate of the allowable costs for the one-year period, with some exclusions. (Estimates for Strategic Partnership Projects may be included in the total fee base, where appropriate.) The total fee base excludes estimates of allowable costs for: source and special nuclear materials; land, buildings, and facilities (whether they are to be leased, purchased or constructed); depreciation of Government facilities; and efforts for which a separate fee is to be negotiated.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) In addition to the exclusions in paragraph (a) of the section, the total fee base excludes:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Any part of the estimated allowable cost of capital equipment that the contractor procures by subcontract and other similar costs that are of such magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort required of the contractor;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) At least 20% of the estimated allowable cost of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements, with the excluded amount increasing as the contractor's estimated required management effort decreases;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Estimates of allowable home office or corporate general and administrative expenses that will be reimbursed;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Any cost of work funded with uncosted balances previously included in a fee base of this or any other contract performed by the contractor;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Cost of rework attributable to the contractor; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) State taxes.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The total fee base does not reflect any fee or compensation for unusual architect-engineer or construction services provided by the M&amp;O contractor. Architect-engineer and construction services are normally covered by special agreements based on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction contracts. The fees for such services shall be calculated per 915.404-4800 and added to the fees calculated using the production, R&amp;D, and EM schedules. The total fee base also does not reflect any fee or compensation for special equipment purchases. The fees for special equipment purchases shall be calculated per 915.404-4800 and added to the fees calculated using the production, R&amp;D, and EM schedules.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) No fee schedule may be used more than once in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period.

An appropriate percentage of 100% would be applied to work of maximum difficulty and/or complexity; lesser percentages would be applied to work less difficult or complex. The significant factors are:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work accomplishment and experience;

         <p class="p P">Usually, the length of an evaluation period is one year, mirroring the one-year period used in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period. The SPE's or designee's approval is required to do otherwise. Nonetheless, the Government's objective is to allocate incentives in a manner that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. Consequently, there may be occasions where after calculating the maximum total available fee amount for a one-year period, part or all of it should be allocated to a subsequent one-year evaluation period, an evaluation period of greater than a year, or to several evaluation periods.

         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Contract term.</em> Effective performance under an M&amp;O contract is facilitated by the use of a relatively long contract term. Only the Secretary can authorize the use of an M&amp;O contract and only the Secretary can renew the original authorization of an M&amp;O contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) An M&amp;O contract shall—after the Secretary has authorized its original use (either by a competitive award or by a sole source award), its maximum term, and any other limits on its terms (options or other terms)—provide for a base term not to exceed the lesser of five years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contract may include option terms provided no option term exceeds the lesser of five years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized (for options or the contract) and the sum of base term and the option terms does not exceed the lesser of 10 years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized for the contract. In addition to the base term and the option terms just described, an M&amp;O contract for a national laboratory that is competitively awarded may provide for award term incentives provided none exceed the maximum term the Secretary authorized for each. The sum of base term, option terms, and award terms shall not exceed the lesser of 20 years or the maximum term the Secretary authorized for the contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) After the Secretary's original authorization of the use of the M&amp;O contract has expired, any continuation of work under an M&amp;O contract must be preceded by the Secretary's renewal of his/her authorization for use of an M&amp;O contract. Whether work is to be continued by a competitive award to a new contractor or to the incumbent, by a sole source award to a new contractor, or by a sole source extension of the contract to the incumbent, the Secretary's renewal of his/her authorization for use of an M&amp;O contract to perform the work is required before work may continue.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) In addition to requiring the Secretary's renewal of his/her authorization for use of an M&amp;O contract, a sole source extension of an M&amp;O contract to the incumbent must be justified under one of the statutory authorities listed in FAR 6.302 and authorized by the Secretary.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The specific duration of the base term, option terms, and award terms of an M&amp;O contract must be established concurrent with the Secretary's authorization (or renewal of his/her authorization) to use an M&amp;O contract (for original use, sole source award to a new contractor, competitive award to a new contractor or to the incumbent, or sole source extension of the contract to the incumbent).


</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Exercise of option.</em> The contracting officer's decision to exercise an option (if the Secretary's authorization to use an M&amp;O contract covers the option period) must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). In deciding to exercise the option, the contracting officer shall:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Consider the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present or can be negotiated into the contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Make the determinations required by FAR 17.605 in the manner described therein. As part of the review required by FAR 17.605(b), the Contracting Officer shall assess whether competing the contract will produce a more advantageous offer than exercising the option. The incumbent contractor's past performance under the contract, the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present, or can be negotiated into the contract, and the impact of a change in a contractor on the Department's discharge of its programs are considerations that shall be addressed in the Contracting Officer's decision that the exercise of the option is in the Government's best interest. The Contracting Officer's decision shall be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s). The determinations described in FAR 17.207(d) and (e)(2) are not required, and because of the way in which the evaluation of cost to the Government is performed in the award of an M&amp;O contract that includes options, the Contracting Officer need only determine the option was evaluated as part of the initial competition and contains a maximum fee. The Contracting Officer need not, for example: issue a new solicitation; informally analyze prices; or determine the option is the more advantageous offer.


</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Conditional Authorization of Non-competitive Extension Made Pursuant to Authority Under CICA.</em> Authorization to extend a management and operating contract by the Head of the Agency shall be considered conditional upon the successful negotiation of the contract to be extended in accordance with the Department's negotiation objectives. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall advise the Senior Procurement Executive no later than 6 months after receipt of the conditional authorization as to whether the Department's objectives will be met and, if not, the contracting activity's plans for competing the requirement.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The extent of Government ownership of the nation's energy plant and materials, and the overriding concerns of national defense and security, impose special conditions on personnel and labor relations in the energy program. Such special conditions include the need for continuity of vital operations at DOE installations; retention by DOE of absolute authority on all questions of security in accordance with 10 CFR 706.40; and DOE review of labor expenses under management and operating (M&amp;O) contracts (and certain other contracts) to assure judicious expenditure of public funds. It is the intent of DOE that personnel and labor policies throughout the energy program reflect the best experience of American industry in aiming to achieve the type of stable labor-management relations that are essential to the proper development of the energy program. The following enunciates the principles upon which the DOE policy is based:
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Employment standards.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			M&amp;O contractors (and certain other non-M&amp;O contractors and subcontractors as described in 970.2201-110) are expected to bring experienced, proven personnel from their private operations to staff key positions on the contract and to recruit other well-qualified personnel as needed. Such personnel should be employed and treated during employment without discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Contractors are required to take affirmative action to achieve these objectives as required by, among other things, the clause at FAR 52.222-26.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) When the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, is applicable (see 904.404), the Contracting Officer will obtain adequate assurance that the Contractor performed the required review of an uncleared applicant's or of an uncleared employee's background in its determination to select an individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Security.</em> In accordance with 10 CFR 706.40, on all matters of security at its facilities, DOE retains absolute authority. Neither the regulations or policies pertaining to security, nor their administration, are matters for collective bargaining between the contractor's management and labor. Insofar as DOE security regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the fullest extent feasible, DOE will consult with representatives of the contractor's management and labor when formulating security regulations and policies that may affect the collective bargaining process.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Wages, salaries, and employee benefits.</em> The aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions which are the substance of collective bargaining in normal organized industries will be left to the orderly processes of negotiation and agreement between contractor management and employee representatives with maximum possible freedom from Government interference and consistent with paragraph (a)(5) of this section and 970.2201-140.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Employee relations.</em> The handling of employee relations on contract work, including such matters as the conduct and discipline of the work force and the handling of employee grievances, is part of the normal management responsibility of the contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Collective bargaining.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			DOE review of collective bargaining practices will be premised on the view that management's trusteeship for the operation of the Government facilities includes the duty to adopt practices (which experience has shown) that are fundamental to the equitable resolution of disputes and promote orderly collective bargaining relationships. Practices inconsistent with this view may be objected to if not found to be otherwise clearly warranted.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Consistent with the policy of assuring continuity of operation of vital facilities, all collective bargaining agreements at DOE-owned facilities should provide that grievances and disputes involving the interpretation or application of the agreement will be settled without resorting to strike, lockout, or other interruption of normal operations. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(5)(ii), each collective bargaining agreement entered into during the period of performance of this contract should provide an effective grievance procedure with arbitration as its final step, unless the parties mutually agree upon some other method of assuring continuity of operation for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) DOE expects its management and operating contractors and the unions representing the contractor's employees to cooperate fully with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Personnel training.</em> DOE encourages and supports personnel training programs aimed at improving work efficiency or developing needed skills which are not otherwise obtainable.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) <em class="ph i">Working conditions.</em> Accident, fire, health, and occupational hazards associated with DOE activities should be held to a practical minimum level and controlled in the interest of maintenance of health and prevention of accidents. Subject to DOE control, to the extent set forth in the terms and conditions of the contract, contractors are required to:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Maintain comprehensive continuous preventive and protective programs appropriate to the particular activities throughout all operations.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Provide appropriate financial protection in case of occupational disability to employees.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Title to payroll and associated records under certain contracts (see 970.0407-120) for the management and operation of DOE facilities, and for necessary miscellaneous construction incidental to the function of these facilities, shall vest in the Government. Such records are to be disposed of in accordance with the clause at 970.5232-3, Accounts, Records, and Inspection, and other DOE directions. For such contracts, the Solicitor of Labor has granted a tolerance from the Department of Labor regulations to omit from the prescribed labor clauses the requirement for the retention of payrolls and associated records for a period of three years after completion of the contract. Under this tolerance, the records retention requirements for all labor clauses in the contract and the Fair Labor Standards Act are satisfied by disposal of such records in accordance with applicable DOE directives.

Critically skilled employees are those employees whose specific recognized technical skills, knowledge, and experience in a specific field are critical to the operations or strategy of a contractor, and whose loss from the DOE contractor's workforce system would cause a significant negative impact on achieving and supporting national research, environmental, defense, and security objectives.
</p>

Some of the specific details of the allowable costs for compensation for personal services are discussed at FAR 31.205-6, as supplemented by, 970.3102-506, and other pertinent parts of the DEAR and DOE directives and policies.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Each state has its own unemployment compensation system to provide payments to workers who become unemployed involuntarily and through no fault of their own. These claims are payable by employers through the state unemployment insurance tax. Some entities such as nonprofits may be permitted to either pay in or opt out. These claims are payable either through the state unemployment insurance tax (pay in) or by reimbursing the state for actual claims paid out to former employees (opt out).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The predictability of paying claims through the state unemployment insurance tax is preferred and highly encouraged. However, an M&amp;O contractor may choose to opt out. A contractor before deciding to opt out, generally performs an analysis of its workforce including size and stability of the workforce, historical turnover rate and historical payout data. This information may also be provided to state regulators who are interested in ensuring that employers who opt out establish an adequate reserve fund to reimburse the state for the claims that are processed for the company's former employees.
</p>

Special provisions relating to patent rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&amp;O contract because of the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded research and development contracts. 


</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Contracting officers must consult with DOE patent counsel assisting the contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting for use in the solicitation, negotiating, or approving appropriate patent rights clauses for a M&amp;O contract. It may be appropriate to include more than one patent rights clause in a solicitation if the successful contractor could, for instance, be either an educational or a large business. If a large business may be selected for performance of a contract that will include a technology transfer clause, the solicitation must include the clause at 970.5227-12 to reflect the waiver that will likely be granted. If the solicitation includes more than one patent clause, it must include an explanation of the circumstances under which the appropriate clause will be used. The final award must contain only one patent rights clause.

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			If the M&amp;O contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201, the clause at 970.5227-10 must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract, except when the M&amp;O contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. The patent rights clause at 970.5227-10 allows the contractor to elect to retain title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of work under the contract in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 200 <em class="ph i">et seq.</em> (the Bayh-Dole Act).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the M&amp;O contractor is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract in accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act, DOE may modify the clause at 970.5227-10 to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program.

				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The clause at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&amp;O contract:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) For any the M&amp;O contractor that does not qualify as a nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201 and for which DOE has not granted a patent waiver pursuant to 10 CFR part 784; or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) If, without regard to the type of contractor, the M&amp;O contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The clause at 970.5227-11 requires the contractor to assign the Government title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under an M&amp;O contract in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 5908 (the Atomic Energy of 1954 and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Act of 1974).






</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Allocation of principal rights: Contractor right to elect title under a patent waiver.</em> DOE may grant a patent waiver for an M&amp;O contractor that does not qualify as a nonprofit organization or a small business firm pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. The patent waiver would allow the contractor to elect to retain title to inventions made in the course of or under the M&amp;O contract. When a patent waiver is granted that covers the M&amp;O contractor, the clause at 970.5227-12 must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract, instead of using the clause at 970.5227-11. The clause at 970.5227-12 may be modified by applicable patent. If the M&amp;O contractor is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract, DOE may modify the patent rights clause to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program.






</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Extensions of time—DOE discretion.</em> The patent rights clauses for M&amp;O contracts require the contractor to take certain actions within prescribed time periods to comply with the contract and preserve its rights in inventions. The M&amp;O contractor may request extensions of time in which to take such actions by submitting written justification to DOE, and DOE may grant the contractor's requests, on a case-by-case basis. If the time period expired due to negligence by the contractor, DOE may grant a request for an extension of time upon a showing by the contractor that corrective procedures are in place to avoid such negligence in the future. If a contractor is requesting an extension of time in which to elect to retain title to an invention, DOE may grant the request if the extension allows the contractor to conduct further experimentation, market research, or other analysis helpful to determine contractor interest in electing title to the invention, among other considerations. Generally, the extensions of time are for periods of between six (6) months to one

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			year. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Facilities license.</em> These include the rights to make, use, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all articles, materials, products, or processes embodying inventions or discoveries used or embodied in the facility regardless of whether or not conceived or first actually reduced to practice under or in the course of such a contract. The patent rights clauses, 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, 970.5227-12, each contain a provision granting the Government this facilities license. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Deletion of classified inventions provision.</em> If DOE determines that the research, development, demonstration or production work to be performed during the course of a management and operating contract most probably will not involve classified subject matter or result in any inventions that require security classification, DOE patent counsel may advise the contracting officer to delete the patent rights clause provision entitled, “Classified Inventions” from the M&amp;O contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Alternate 1—Weapons Related Research or Production.</em> If DOE grants technology transfer authority to a DOE facility, pursuant to Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), and the DOE owned facility is involved in weapons related research and development, or production, then Alternate 1 of the patent rights clauses must be inserted into the M&amp;O contract. Alternate 1 defines weapons related subject inventions and restricts the contractor's rights with respect to such inventions. 




</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Allocation of principal rights: Subcontractor rights to elect title under Bayh-Dole provisions.</em> When the M&amp;O contractor is issuing a subcontract to a nonprofit organization or small business firm as defined by 35 U.S.C. 201, the subcontractor retains all rights provided in the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.3(a) and 401.14 and adding Alternate I of 48 CFR 952.227-11, Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor, that includes the agency implementing regulations specific for DOE. If the S&amp;E DEC, or any other related DEC to substantial U.S. manufacturing policy, is applicable, the Contractor shall include Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-11, Patent Rights-Retention by the Contractor.

         <p class="p List1">(a) Rights in data relating to the performance of the contract and to all facilities are significant in assuring continuity of the management and operation of DOE facilities. It is crucial in assuring DOE's continuing ability to perform its statutory missions that DOE obtain rights to all data produced or specifically used by its management and operating contractors and appropriate subcontractors. In order to obtain the necessary rights in technical data, DOE contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contracts contain either the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. Selection of the appropriate clause is dependent upon whether technology transfer is a mission of the management and operating contract pursuant to the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 <em class="ph i">et seq.,</em> as amended). If technology transfer is not a mission of the management and operating contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, shall be used. In those instances in which technology transfer is a mission of the contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, shall be used. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Employees of the management and operating contractor may not be used to assist in the preparation of a proposal or bid for services which are similar or related to those being performed under the contract, which are to be performed by the contractor or its parent or affiliate organization for commercial customers unless the employee has been separated from work under the DOE contract for such period as the Head of the Contracting Activity or designee shall have directed.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The clauses at 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, both provide generally for Government ownership and for unlimited rights in the Government for all data first produced in the performance of the contract and unlimited rights in data specifically used in the performance of the contract. Both clauses provide that, subject to patent, security, and other provisions of the contract, the contractor may use contract data for its private purposes. The contractor, under either clause, must treat any data furnished by DOE or acquired from other Government agencies or private entities in the performance of their contracts in accordance with any restrictive legends contained therein. For Research and Development Contracting, requirements for R&amp;D results conveyed in scientific and technical information are addressed in 935.010 and should be set forth as part of the contract. These contractual requirements are further addressed in DOE Order 241.1B, or its successor version, which sets forth requirements for scientific and technical information.




</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Since both clauses secure access to and, if requested, delivery of technical data used in the performance of the contract, there is generally no need to use the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in the management and operating contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(c)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Paragraph (d) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraph (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the inclusion in subcontracts of the Rights in Technical Data—General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, with Alternate V, and modified in accordance with DEAR 927.409. Those clauses also provide for the inclusion in appropriate subcontracts Alternates II, III, and IV to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 with DOE's prior approval and the inclusion of the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in all subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration and all other subcontracts having special requirements for the production or delivery of data. In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated by the contractor under its contract with DOE, the management and operating contractor shall use the Rights in Data—Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Where, however, a subcontract is to be awarded by the management and operating contractor in connection with a program, as discussed at 927.404-71, which provides statutory authority to protect from public disclosure, data first produced under contracts awarded pursuant to the program, contracting officers shall ensure that the management and operating contractor includes in that subcontract the rights in data clause provided by DOE Patent Counsel, consistent with any accompanying guidance.




</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Management and operating contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, nor may they acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software except through the use of Alternate II or III to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(d)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraphs (g) and (h) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the contractor's granting a nonexclusive license in any limited rights data and restricted computer software specifically used in performance of the contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In certain instances the objectives of DOE would be frustrated if the Government did not obtain, at the time of contracting, limited license rights on behalf of responsible third parties and the Government, and to limited rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in the performance of the contract. This situation may arise in the performance of management and operating contracts and contracts for the management or operation of a DOE facility or site. Contracting officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). Where such a background license is in DOE's interest, a provision that provides substantially as Alternate VI at 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be added to the appropriate clause, 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. 




</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) The Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2 differs from the clause at 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in the context of its more detailed treatment of copyright. In management and operating contracts that have technology transfer as a mission, the right to assert copyright in data first produced under the contract will be a valuable right, and commercialization of such data, including computer software, will assist the management and operating contractor in advancing the technology transfer mission of the contract. The clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provides for DOE approval of DOE's taking a limited copyright license during the period in which the copyrighted data is being commercialized. The contractor must notify DOE (Patent Counsel and Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI)) when commercial activity ceases.


</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Contracting officers should consult with Patent Counsel to assure that requirements regarding royalties and conflicts of interest associated with asserting copyright in data first produced under the contract are appropriately addressed in the Technology Transfer Mission clause (48 CFR 970.5227-3) of the management and operating contract. Where it is not otherwise clear which DOE program funded the development of a computer software package, such as where the development was funded out of a contractor's overhead account, the DOE program which was the primary source of funding for the entire contract is deemed to have administrative responsibility. This issue may arise, among others, in the decision whether to grant the contractor permission to assert copyright. See paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) In management and operating contracts involving access to DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related restricted data and technology. Alternate I to each clause shall be used where access to Category C-24 restricted data is contemplated in the performance of a contract.

In implementing the NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause required by this subpart.

         <span class="ph autonumber">970.3102-370</span> Home office expenses.</h3>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) For on-site work, DOE's fee for management and operating contracts, determined under the policy of and calculated per the procedures in 970.1504-103, generally provides adequate compensation for home or corporate office general and administrative expenses incurred in the general management of the contractor's business as a whole.


</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) DOE recognizes that some Home Office Expenses are incurred for the benefit of a management and operating contract. DOE has elected to recognize that benefit through fee due to the difficulty of determining the dollar value applicable to any management and operating contract. The difficulty arises because: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The general construct of a management and operating contract results in minimal Home Office involvement in the contract work, and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Conventional Home Office Expense allocation techniques that use bases such as total operating costs, labor dollars, hours etc., are not appropriate because they inherently assume significant contractor investment (in terms of its own resources, such as, labor, material, overhead, etc.). Contractor investments are minimal under DOE's operating and management contracts. The contracts are totally financed by DOE advance payments, and DOE provides government-owned facilities, property, and other needed resources. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) From time to time, the fee for a management and operating contract may not be adequate compensation for Home Office Expenses incurred for the benefit of the contract. An indication that such a case exists is the need for significant home office support to deal with issues at the site that occur without the fault or negligence of the contractor, for example, the need for home office legal support to deal with third party, environmental, safety, or health issues. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In such a case, the contracting officer, after obtaining the HCA's approval, may consider a contractor request for additional compensation. The contractor may request— 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Fee in addition to its normal fee; or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Compensation on the basis of actual cost. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Because the contract's fee provides some compensation for Home Office Expenses, the contractor's request for additional compensation must always be for an amount less than the Home Office Expenses that are incurred for the benefit of the management and operating contract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) For off-site work, the DOE allows Home Office Expenses under architect-engineer, supply and research contracts with commercial contractors performing the work in their own facilities. Home Office Expenses may, however, be included for reimbursement under such DOE off-site architect-engineer, supply and research contracts, only to the extent that they are determined, after careful examination, to be allowable, reasonable, and properly allocable to the work. Work performed in a contractor's own facilities under a management and operating or construction contract may likewise be allowed to bear the properly allocable portion of allowable Home Office Expenses.

         <p class="p Runin List1">(a)(6) In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies, programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees. However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE cost-type contracts.

The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed changes in any matters covered by these policies, practices, or plans which relate to personnel costs. Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed in the contract are as follows: Salaries and wages; bonuses and incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, holiday, and other premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and retirement programs; paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees in their capacity as union stewards and committeemen for time spent in handling grievances, or serving on labor management (contractor) committees provided, however, that the contracting officer's approval is required in each instance of total compensation to an individual employee above an annual rate as specified in the contract.

			Costs incurred by contractor personnel on official company business are allowable, subject to the limitations contained in this subsection. Costs for transportation may be based on mileage rates, actual costs incurred, or on a combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable charge. Costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses may be based on per diem, actual expenses, or a combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable charge. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses (as defined in the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)

         <p class="p List3">(i) Federal Travel Regulation, prescribed by the General Services Administration (41 CFR chapters 300 through 304), for travel in the conterminous 48 United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 922-002-00000-2; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Joint Travel Regulations, DoD Civilian Personnel, Appendix A, prescribed by the Department of Defense, for travel in Alaska, Hawaii, The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of the United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 908-010-00000-1; or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), section 925, “Maximum Travel Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas,” prescribed by the Department of State, for travel in areas not covered in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 744-008-00000-0. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In special or unusual situations, actual costs in excess of the maximum per diem rates are allowable provided that such amounts do not exceed the higher amounts authorized for Federal civilian employees as permitted in the regulations referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection. For such higher amounts to be allowable, all of the following conditions must be met: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) One of the conditions warranting approval of the actual expense method, as set forth in the regulations referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, must exist. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A written justification for use of the higher amounts must be approved by an officer of the contractor's organization or designee to ensure that the authority is properly administered and controlled to prevent abuse. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) If it becomes necessary to exercise the authority to use the higher actual expense method repetitively or on a continuing basis in a particular area, the contractor must obtain advance approval from the contracting officer. 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Documentation to support actual costs incurred shall be in accordance with the contractor's established practices, subject to paragraph (a)(7) of this subsection, and provided that a receipt is required for each expenditure of $75.00 or more. The approved justification required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) and, if applicable, paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this subsection must be retained. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection do not incorporate the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this subsection in their entirety. Only the maximum per diem rates, the definitions of lodging, meals, and incidental expenses, and the regulatory coverage dealing with special or unusual situations are incorporated in this subsection. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) An advance agreement (see 48 CFR 31.109 and 970.3101-9) with respect to compliance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection may be useful and desirable.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(6)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			The maximum per diem rates referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection generally would not constitute a reasonable daily charge— 
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) When no lodging costs are incurred; and/or 
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) On partial travel days (e.g., day of departure and return). 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem rates would normally be required under these circumstances. While these adjustments need not be calculated in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation or Joint Travel Regulations, they must result in a reasonable charge. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) Costs shall be allowable only if the following information is documented: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Date and place (city, town, or other similar designation) of the expenses; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Purpose of the trip; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Name of person on trip and that person's title or relationship to the contractor. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Travel costs incurred in the normal course of overall administration of the business are allowable and shall be treated as indirect costs. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Travel costs directly attributable to specific contract performance are allowable and may be charged to the contract under 48 CFR 31.202. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Airfare costs in excess of the lowest customary standard, coach, or equivalent airfare offered during normal business hours are unallowable except when such accommodations require circuitous routing, require travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolong travel, result in increased cost that would offset transportation savings, are not reasonably adequate for the physical or medical needs of the traveler, or are not reasonably available to meet mission requirements. However, in order for airfare costs in excess of the standard airfare to be allowable, the applicable condition(s) must be documented and justified. 
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(e)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			“Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft,” as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the standard airfare described in paragraph (d) of this subsection for the flight destination unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for justifying higher than standard airfare listed in paragraph (d) of this subsection are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph (e)(3) of this subsection has been executed. In all cases, travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall indicate— 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Date, time, and points of departure; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Destination, date, and time of arrival; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Name of each passenger and relationship to the contractor; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Authorization for trip; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Purpose of trip. 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Where an advance agreement is proposed (see 48 CFR 31.109), consideration may be given to the following: 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently; 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh additional travel costs. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used for company business. That portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is compensation for personal services and is unallowable as stated in 48 CFR 31.205-6(m)(2).

         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or a court has previously ruled as unallowable; or

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Expressly unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to the contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost.

         <p class="p List2">(1) It determines that it would be in the best interest of the United States to waive such certification; and

         <p class="p List1">(a) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall establish thresholds, by subcontract type and dollar level, for the review and approval of proposed subcontracting actions by each management and operating contractor under their cognizance. Such thresholds may not exceed the authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive. In establishing these thresholds, the Heads of the Contracting Activities should consider such factors as the following—
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The nature of work to be performed under the management and operating contract; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The size, experience, ability, reliability, and organization of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function;

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Policies with respect to such reviews and approvals established by the Senior Procurement Executive. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Prior approval shall be required for the subcontracting of any work a contractor is obligated to perform under a contract entered into under section 41, entitled Production of Special Nuclear Material, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall take such action as may be required to insure compliance with the procedure for purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources or the purchase of specific items, or classes of items, which by the terms of the contract may require DOE approval. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The Heads of the Contracting Activities may raise or lower the review and approval thresholds established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection at any time. Such action may be considered upon the periodic review of the contractor's purchasing system, but in any case those adjusted thresholds may not exceed the approval authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) DOE approvals of specific proposed purchases pursuant to this subpart shall communicate that such approval does not relieve the management and operating contractor of any obligation under its prime contract with DOE; is given without prejudice to any rights or claims of the Government thereunder; creates no obligation on the part of the Government to the subcontractor, and is not a predetermination of the allowability of costs to be incurred under the subcontract. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors establish and maintain subcontract files which contain those documents essential to present an accurate and adequate record of all purchasing transactions. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors document purchases in writing, setting forth the information and data used in determining that the purchases are in the best interest of the Government. The scope and detail of this documentation shall be consistent with the nature, dollar value, and complexity of the purchase. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall assure that the contracting activity establishes and maintains files of the documents associated with the review and approval of subcontract actions subject to DOE review and approval. Those files shall include, among other necessary documentation, an appraisal of the proposed action by the contracting activity and a copy of the approving or disapproving document forwarded to the management and operating contractor, including a listing of any deficiencies, a listing of any required corrective actions, any suggestions, or other relevant comments.

         <p class="p List1">(a) The objective of a management and operating contractor's purchasing system is to deliver to its customers on a timely basis those best value products and services necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government's contract. To achieve this objective, contractors are expected to use their experience, expertise and initiative consistent with this subpart. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The purchasing systems and methods used by management and operating contractors shall be well-defined, consistently applied, and shall follow purchasing practices appropriate for the requirement and dollar value of the purchase. It is anticipated that purchasing practices and procedures will vary among contractors and according to the type and kinds of purchases to be made. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Contractor purchases are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect contractor purchasing, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.

         <p class="p List1">(d) Contractor purchasing systems shall identify and apply the best in commercial purchasing practices and procedures (although nothing precludes the adoption of Federal procurement practices and procedures) to achieve system objectives. Where specific requirements do not otherwise apply, the contractor purchasing system shall provide for appropriate measures to ensure the—

         <p class="p List2">(1) Acquisition of quality products and services at fair and reasonable prices;

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Subcontracts for performance of contract work itself (as distinguished from the purchase of supplies and services needed in connection with the performance of work) require DOE authorization and may involve an adjustment of the contractor's fee, if any. If the management and operating contractor seeks authorization to have some part of the contract work performed by a contractor-affiliated source, and that contractor's performance of that work was a factor in the negotiated fee, DOE approval would normally require—

         <p class="p List2">(2) An equitable downward adjustment to the management and operating contractor's fee, if any. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Determination on cost of money allowance as prescribed at 48 CFR 31.225-10 shall be treated as follows: 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source results from competition and is in accord with provisions and conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this subsection, the contractor-affiliated source may include cost of money as an allowable element of the costs of its goods or services supplied to the contractor; provided—

         <p class="p List3">(i) The purchase is based on cost as set forth in 48 CFR 31.205-26(e); and 
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The cost of money amount is computed in accordance with 48 CFR 31.205-10 and related procedures (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Part_970_T48_5032641.html#Subpart_970_30_T48_503264117">970.30</a>).

         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Fee negotiations.</em> For any fee negotiations under this contract, at any time prior to the beginning of the evaluation period the negotiations cover, the Contracting Officer and Contractor shall attempt to reach agreement on: the requirements for the evaluation period including, if appropriate, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives; the total available fee amount of the evaluation period; and the allocation of the total available fee amount. If agreement is reached prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, the Contracting Officer shall modify the contract to reflect the agreement. If agreement is not reached prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, the Contracting Officer will, prior to the beginning of the evaluation period, unilaterally determine: the requirements of the evaluation period including, if appropriate, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee amount, and the allocation of the total available fee amount. The Contracting Officer shall modify the contract to reflect the determination.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Determination of total available fee amount earned.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Department of Energy (DOE) shall, at the conclusion of each specified evaluation period, evaluate the Contractor's performance of all requirements, and determine the total available fee amount earned. At DOE's discretion, if the contact established specific incentivized requirements and a schedule for their completion and the Contractor completes them during the evaluation period, DOE may evaluate the Contractor's performance upon the requirements' completion. The Contractor agrees the determination of the total available fee amount earned is a unilateral determination made by the Fee Determining Official (FDO). DOE will identify the FDO. The FDO will be the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or another DOE official designated by the Assistant Secretary or equivalent (not delegable).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the award fee cycle consists of one evaluation period, award fee not earned during the evaluation period shall not be allocated to future evaluation periods. At the sole discretion of DOE, if the award fee cycle consists of more than one evaluation period, award fee not earned during the evaluation period may be allocated to future evaluation periods within the same award fee cycle.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Following each evaluation period, the Contractor [insert may or shall] submit a self-assessment within [insert number] calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct them and avoid their recurrence. The FDO will review the Contractor's self-assessment as part of the evaluation of the Contractor's performance during the period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The FDO will evaluate the Contractor's performance in accordance with the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan (PEMP) described in paragraph (d) of this clause unless otherwise set forth in the contract. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the total available fee amount earned determination and the basis of the determination.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">PEMP.</em> To the extent not set forth elsewhere in the contract:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) DOE shall establish a PEMP upon which the determination of the total available fee amount earned shall be based. The PEMP will address all of the requirements of contract performance specified in the contract directly or by reference. The Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with a copy of the PEMP before the start of an evaluation period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The PEMP will set forth the criteria upon which the Contractor will be evaluated relating to any technical, schedule, management, and/or cost objectives selected for evaluation. The PEMP will include, per 48 CFR 16.402-1, a cost incentive (or constraint). The criteria in the PEMP should be objective but may also include subjective criteria. The PEMP will set forth the method by which the total available fee amount will be allocated, and the total available fee amount earned will be determined.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The PEMP may be revised, either unilaterally (by DOE) or bilaterally, during the evaluation period. If it is revised, the Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Of unilateral revisions (unless they are urgent and high priority) at least ninety calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period and at least thirty calendar days prior to the effective date of the revision;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Of bilateral revisions (unless they are urgent and high priority) at least sixty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Of urgent and high priority revisions, whether made unilaterally or bilaterally, at least thirty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Schedule for total available fee amount earned determinations.</em> The FDO shall issue the final total available fee amount earned determination in accordance with the schedule set forth in the PEMP or as otherwise set forth in this contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The determination for the evaluation period must be made within the later of: sixty calendar days after the receipt by the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's self-assessment, if one is required or permitted; seventy calendar days after the end of the evaluation period; or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If the FDO elects to evaluate the Contractor's performance of any specific requirements upon their completion, the determination of any fee amount earned must be made: within seventy calendar days of the requirements' completion; or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the determination is not made within the periods stated above, the Contractor shall be entitled to interest on the total available fee amount earned at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 7109) that is in effect on the payment date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest on any late total available fee amount earned determination will accrue daily and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the schedule determination date through the actual date the determination is made. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the total available fee amount earned and be subject to interest if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.

</p>
         <p class="p HD3">Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts [December 2024]
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> “Amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period” means the quantity the Contracting Officer or Fee Determining Official determines the Contractor is due for its performance in consideration of the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan, Award Fee Plan, or similar document prior to a separate determination that the Contractor did not comply with a term or condition of the contract or experienced a failure relating to: environment, safety, and health or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. If the contract includes incentives allocable to more than one evaluation period, the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period includes the allocable amount of payment for each such incentive for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives. The allocable amount is the total amount divided by the number of evaluation periods the incentive covered. “Amount actually payable to the Contractor for an evaluation period” means: (the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period) less (the amount of any reduction under this clause and the amount of any reductions under other clauses to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">General.</em> (Note: If this contract does not include the Security Requirements clause (48 CFR 952.204-2), the requirements of this clause related to security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information do not apply.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for any evaluation period under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's and the Contractor's employees' compliance during the evaluation period with the performance requirements of this contract relating to:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Environment, safety and health (ES&amp;H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&amp;H); and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The ES&amp;H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including the DOE-approved contractor Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&amp;H compliance.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of this contract are set forth in: the clause of this contract entitled, “Security Requirements”; the clause of this contract entitled “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives”; and other terms and conditions of this contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&amp;H or security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information during any evaluation period established under the contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount,” the amount of payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or other incentives for the evaluation period may be unilaterally reduced by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Amount of Reduction.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contracting Officer will unilaterally determine the amount of reduction to the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for an evaluation period based on the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees of failure specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause. The percent reduction for each performance failure will be: not less than 26% nor more than 100% for a first degree failure; not less than 11% or more than 26% for a second degree failure; and no more than 11% for a third degree failure.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) For a reduction allocable to more than one evaluation period, the Government will effect the allocation at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount of the reduction. The allocable amount is the total reduction amount divided by the number of evaluation periods the reduction covered.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Government will reduce the payment of otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives as soon as practicable after the end of the evaluation period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practicable after becoming aware.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) In determining the reduction and in applying the mitigating factors, the Contracting Officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&amp;H, and security or safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information performance requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site-specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition or guidance for the amount of reduction or for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the Contracting Office must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the reduction that would be appropriate absent mitigating factors. Mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following (paragraphs (c)(4)(v), (vi), (vii), and (viii) of this clause apply to ES&amp;H only):
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Efforts the Contractor made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: ES&amp;H and compliance in related areas; or of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related areas;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&amp;H standards are routinely practiced;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> offsite emergency response);
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&amp;H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> policy, ES&amp;H programs); and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) Contractor demonstration that an operating experience and feedback program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&amp;H by use of lessons learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Reductions to the amount of payments the Contractor has received for earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives under this and other clauses.</em>
                              </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The amount of the reduction under this clause for an evaluation period, in combination with the amount of any reduction under any other clause, shall not exceed the amount of payment for otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives for the evaluation period.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) If at any time during the contract any reductions under this clause or other clauses result in the sum of the amount of payments the Contractor has received for earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or other incentives to exceed the sum of the amounts of actually payable to the Contractor, the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) At the end of the contract—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of amounts actually payable to the Contractor exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of the amounts actually payable to the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Environment, Safety and Health (ES&amp;H).</em> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&amp;H terms and conditions, including applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, DOE directives, and the DOE approved Contractor ISMS. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of earned or fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">First Degree.</em> Performance failures most adverse to ES&amp;H are first degree. They include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS. (The Government will perform necessary reviews in a timely manner and not unreasonably withhold approval.)
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Performance failures determined, per applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or that could reasonably be expected to result in, serious injury or death to a worker.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Occurrence of any accident or event that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) and results in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Second Degree.</em> Performance failures significantly adverse to ES&amp;H are second degree. They include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Failures to comply with an approved ISMS.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Failures that have been determined, per applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives, to have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an actual injury, exposure, or exceedance that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A breakdown of the Safety Management System.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Non-compliance with applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in an accident that meets the criteria of Appendix A of DOE Order 225.1B (or successor Order) but not resulting in a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Non-compliance with applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives that results in a near miss of an accident or event that could have resulted in an adverse effect and a determination to conduct a Federal Accident Investigation Board. (A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, that does not result in an adverse effect.)
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Third Degree.</em> Performance failures determined per applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives to reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&amp;H are third degree. They include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Non-compliance with applicable ES&amp;H laws, regulations, or DOE directives actually resulting in potential breakdown of the Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through: external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 231.B (or successor Order) requirements; or internal oversight of 10 CFR parts 830, 835, 850, and 851, or DOE Orders 227.1A and 436.1 (or successor Order) requirements.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Non-compliances that have, or may have, significant negative impacts to the worker, the public, or the environment or that indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Security or Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information.</em> Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee, profit, or other incentives will be determined are as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">First Degree.</em> Performance failures determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security are first degree. The following are examples:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in an SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in an SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Second Degree.</em> Performance failures determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security are second degree. The following are examples:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this clause).
</p>

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Third Degree.</em> Performance failures determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security are third degree. This category also includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future more severe performance failures and/or conditions that if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures that by themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.

         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 970.1708-3, insert the following clause:
</p>
         <p class="p HD3">Agreements for Commercializing Technology (Act) [December 2024]
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) This clause authorizes the use of the mechanism, Agreements for Commercializing Technology (ACT). In accordance with the requirements specified in this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor may conduct third party-sponsored research at the M&amp;O Contractor's risk. While the Department believes ACT has the potential to greatly assist in the commercialization of technologies, it also specifically recognizes that ACT can be used for other engagements with outside entities that are not necessary aimed at commercialization (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> technical assistance, training, studies), but that facilitate access to DOE facilities. In performing ACT work, the M&amp;O Contractor may use staff and other resources associated with this M&amp;O contract for the purposes of conducting technical services, training, studies, performing research and development, and/or furthering the technology transfer mission of the Department, only when such work does not interfere with DOE-funded activities conducted as authorized by other parts of this M&amp;O contract. Any allocation of resources that adversely affects work for DOE due to performing ACT work is the responsibility of the M&amp;O Contractor. The resources that may be used include Government-owned or leased facilities, equipment, or other property that is either in the M&amp;O Contractor's custody or available to the M&amp;O Contractor under this M&amp;O contract (unless specifically excluded by the Contracting Officer). For M&amp;O Contractor activities conducted under authority of this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor shall provide full-cost recovery, assume indemnification and liability as provided in paragraph (b)(9) below, and may assume other risks normally borne by private parties sponsoring research at the DOE national laboratories and production plants. In exchange for accepting such risks, or for other private consideration provided by the M&amp;O Contractor, the M&amp;O Contractor is authorized to negotiate separate ACT agreements with the sponsoring third parties. Under ACT agreements, the M&amp;O Contractor may charge those parties additional compensation beyond the full costs of the work at the facility.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The following applies to all work conducted under the ACT mechanism, regardless of the source of funding:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Authority to Perform work under this clause.</em> Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 <em class="ph i">et seq.</em>) and other applicable authorities, the M&amp;O Contractor may perform work for non-Federal entities, in accordance with the requirements of this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">M&amp;O Contractor's Implementation.</em> For ACT work conducted under the contract, the M&amp;O Contractor must draft, implement, and maintain formal policies, practices, and procedures in accordance with this clause, which must be approved by the Contracting Officer, and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Conditions for Participation in ACT.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor: 
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Must not perform ACT activities that would place it in direct competition with the private sector;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) May only conduct work under this clause if the work does not interfere with or adversely affect projects and programs the M&amp;O Contractor conducts on behalf of the DOE under this contract, and complies with the terms and conditions of the prime contract If the Government determines that an activity conducted under this clause interferes with the Department's work under the M&amp;O contract, or that termination/stay/suspension of work under an ACT agreement is in the best interest of the Government, the M&amp;O Contractor must stop the interfering ACT work immediately to the extent necessary to resolve the interference. At any time, the Contracting Officer may require the use of specified Government-owned or leased property and facilities for the exclusive use of the DOE mission by providing a written notice excluding said property from the M&amp;O Contractor's activities under this clause. Any cost incurred as a result of Contracting Officer decisions identified in this paragraph shall be borne by the M&amp;O Contractor. The Contracting Officer shall provide to the M&amp;O Contractor in writing its decision, identifying the issues and reasons for the decisions. The M&amp;O Contractor shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to address and resolve the issues identified by the Contracting Officer;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) Except as otherwise excluded in this clause, must perform all ACT activities in accordance with the standards, policies, and procedures that apply to performance under this M&amp;O contract, including but not limited to environmental, safety and health, security, safeguards, conflict of interest and classification procedures, and human and animal research regulations;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) Must maintain and provide when requested by the DOE Contracting Officer, a summary of project information for each active ACT project, consisting of: sponsor name; total estimated costs; project title and description; project point of contact; and estimated start and completion dates;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(v) Is responsible for addressing the following items in ACT agreements as appropriate: disposition of property acquired under the agreement; export control; notice of intellectual property infringement; and a statement that the Government and/or the M&amp;O Contractor shall have the right to perform similar services in the Statement of Work for other Parties as otherwise authorized by this M&amp;O contract subject to applicable data restrictions;
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vi) Must include a standard legal disclaimer notice on all publications generated under ACT activities. Each DOE M&amp;O Contractor has its own pre-approved publications statement, and this should be included; and
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vii) Must insert the following disclaimer in each agreement under ACT, which must be conspicuous (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> bold type, all capital letters, or large font) in all Agreements under ACT so as to meet the standards of due notice.
</p>
         <p class="p P">DISCLAIMER
</p>
         <p class="p P">THIS AGREEMENT IS SOLELY BETWEEN [INSERT NAME OF THE M&amp;O CONTRACTOR] AND [THE OTHER IDENTIFIED PARTY]. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS <em class="ph i">NOT</em> A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT CREATE ANY OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AS TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE RESEARCH OR ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, GENERATED INFORMATION, OR PRODUCT MADE OR DEVELOPED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE OWNERSHIP, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH OR RESULTING PRODUCT; THAT THE GOODS, SERVICES, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, INFORMATION, OR DATA TO BE FURNISHED HEREUNDER WILL ACCOMPLISH INTENDED RESULTS OR ARE SAFE FOR ANY PURPOSE INCLUDING THE INTENDED PURPOSE; OR THAT ANY OF THE ABOVE WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH PRIVATELY OWNED RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH RESEARCH OR RESULTING PRODUCT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, GENERATED INFORMATION, OR PRODUCT MADE OR DELIVERED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS DISCLAIMER DOES NOT AFFECT ANY RIGHTS THE GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE AGAINST THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM WORK CONDUCTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>
         <p class="p P Runin">(4) <em class="ph i">Contracting Authority.</em> (i) Subject to DOE approval as described in this paragraph, the M&amp;O Contractor is hereby authorized to negotiate terms and conditions between the M&amp;O Contractor and third parties when entering into ACT agreements. The M&amp;O Contractor will have no authority to bind the Government in any way with such terms and conditions. The Government will have no obligation to the M&amp;O Contractor due to such terms and conditions.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) The M&amp;O Contractor shall submit an ACT proposal package (Package) to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to beginning work under an ACT agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(A) A complete Package will include at a minimum: the identity of the parties to the ACT agreement; the principal place of performance; any foreign ownership or control of the ACT agreement parties; a Statement of Work; an estimate of costs incurred under the M&amp;O contract; an anticipated schedule; identification of key Government equipment and facilities that will be used under the ACT agreement; a list of expected deliverables; identification of the Intellectual Property (IP) lead and proposed selection of IP rights, as defined in DOE Class Waiver W(C)-2011-013; a signed certification by the private party(ies) that the M&amp;O Contractor offered the option to use Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) alternatives (see paragraph (b)(7)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			of this clause) sufficiently such that the private parties are aware of the relative costs and other differences between the ACT agreement and the CRADA and SPP alternatives; source of funds, including a statement that no Federal funds, including pass-through funds received as a subcontractor or partner, are being utilized; applicable ES&amp;H and NEPA documentation; a statement of consideration, summarizing the risk and/or consideration offered the ACT participants in exchange for charging beyond full cost recovery or for other compensation provided by the participants; and when multiple third parties are parties to the ACT agreement, or as otherwise requested by the Contracting Officer, an IP Management Plan that sets forth the proposed disposition of IP rights, and income and royalty sharing, among the parties to an ACT agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) If the M&amp;O Contractor, the M&amp;O Contractor's parent, member, subsidiary, or other entity in which the M&amp;O Contractor, the M&amp;O Contractor's parent, member or subsidiary has an equity interest, is a party to the ACT agreement, the M&amp;O Contractor shall include as necessary a project-specific addendum to the Master OCI Plan in the Package to address special circumstances not fully anticipated in the prior approved Master OCI Plan (see paragraph (b)(7) of this clause).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(C) If the ACT agreement includes a foreign entity as a party or the statement of work includes the use of human subjects, animal subjects, classified or sensitive subject matter or describes a work scope involving high risks or hazards including environmental issues, the M&amp;O Contractor shall include additional information as necessary or as requested by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) The Contracting Officer shall use reasonable best efforts to review each complete Package submitted by the M&amp;O Contractor under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this clause within 10 business days of receiving the Package and provide the M&amp;O Contractor with approval or non-approval of the Package. The review of the complete Package by the Contracting Officer shall include a determination that the proposed work: is consistent with or complementary to DOE missions and the contract statement of work; will not adversely impact programs under the contract scope of work; will not place the contractor in direct competition with the domestic private sector; and will not create a detrimental future burden on DOE resources.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) Except as conditionally allowed under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this clause, the Contracting Officer must approve the Package before the M&amp;O Contractor may begin work under the proposed ACT agreement. If the Contracting Officer rejects the Package, then the Contracting Officer must provide said rejection to the M&amp;O Contractor in writing including the reasons for the rejection. Upon receipt of the Contracting Officer's written rejection, the M&amp;O Contractor agrees to not further pursue the work described in the package or incur additional costs under the M&amp;O contract for the work described in the Package.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(A) The M&amp;O Contractor may request a preliminary determination that the proposed scope of work is consistent with the contract statement of work and the Contracting Officer will use his/her best efforts to provide such a determination within three business days. Upon such a determination from the Contracting Officer, the M&amp;O Contractor may begin work under the ACT agreement at the M&amp;O Contractor's risk pending final approval of the complete Package. The M&amp;O Contractor must submit a complete Package, as identified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this clause, within 10 business days of the preliminary determination. All costs associated with the performance of work under a preliminary determination are the responsibility of the M&amp;O Contractor, as no Federal funds will be used to fund any work conducted under this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) If any source affiliated with the M&amp;O Contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the M&amp;O Contractor or its parent company) is a party sponsoring work in connection with the ACT agreement, work may not commence until approval of the complete Package by the Contracting Officer.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(5) <em class="ph i">Advance Payment for ACT Projects.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall be responsible for providing adequate advance payment for ACT work conducted under this clause consistent with procedures defined in the Department's Financial Management Handbook. The M&amp;O Contractor shall be solely responsible for collecting payments from third parties for any work conducted under this clause and such collections shall be independent of providing advance payment. For such payments and for any costs, obligations, or liabilities arising due to the M&amp;O Contractor's work under this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor is entirely at risk and the Government shall have no risk.
</p>
         <p class="p P Runin">(6) <em class="ph i">Costs and Fee.</em> (i) All direct costs associated with the M&amp;O Contractor's work conducted under this clause shall be directly charged to separate and identifiable accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Department's Financial Management Handbook. An allocable portion of indirect costs normally applied to equivalent work under this M&amp;O contract shall also be applied to work conducted under this clause in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Management Handbook. As required by the Financial Management Handbook, changes to the Handbook will be incorporated into this clause by a unilateral administrative modification to the contract. In addition, all work must be performed at full costs that would include Federal Administrative Charge (FAC).
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) Work conducted under this clause shall be excluded from the M&amp;O contract award fee calculations and such fee shall not be allocable to work conducted under this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(7) <em class="ph i">Organizational Conflict of Interest.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall conduct work under this clause in a manner that minimizes the appearance of conflicts of interest and avoids or mitigates actual conflicts of interest with the M&amp;O Contractor's functions under this M&amp;O contract. Accordingly, the M&amp;O Contractor shall develop an Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan (OCI Plan). The OCI Plan should address OCI issues that arise as a result of the M&amp;O Contractor taking a financial interest in ACT projects, especially in those cases where the M&amp;O Contractor retains rights in ACT IP. Said OCI Plan shall be provided to the Contracting Officer for review and approval as soon as practicable after execution of the M&amp;O contract modification incorporating this clause into the M&amp;O contract. Unless provided otherwise by the Contracting Officer, no work on ACT agreements may commence before Contracting Officer approval of the OCI Plan. In addition to those elements expressly stated in the OCI Plan, the Department may condition any ACT transaction on such other mitigating conditions it determines are appropriate. The OCI Plan shall, at a minimum, include elements that address the following:
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Full Disclosure.</em> Before work can begin under an ACT transaction, all parties to ACT agreements must sign a DOE-approved certification that they have been fully informed about the availability of SPP agreements and CRADAs in addition to ACT. The certification at a minimum shall briefly describe SPP agreements, CRADAs and ACT, and will include the relative disposition of IP rights and the costs (including identification of any additional costs <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> insurance, and other compensation to the M&amp;O Contractor under ACT) for each type of agreement for the scope of work being proposed.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) <em class="ph i">Priority of Work.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall not give work under ACT any special attention or priority over other work under the DOE M&amp;O contract. Work under ACT shall be approved by the Contracting Officer and assigned the same priority relative to other work under the DOE M&amp;O contract that it would normally have if performed under a non-Federal SPP agreement. The Contracting Officer has discretion to determine the agency's priority of work, considering the M&amp;O Contractor's input.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) <em class="ph i">Participation by Contractor-affiliated sources:</em> If any source affiliated with the M&amp;O Contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the M&amp;O Contractor or its parent company) is a party to the ACT agreement, the M&amp;O Contractor shall include as necessary an addendum to the OCI Plan to address special circumstances not fully anticipated in the OCI Plan.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) <em class="ph i">Right of Inquiry for ACT IP Designation.</em> The Contracting Officer, upon request of DOE Patent Counsel may inquire into the M&amp;O Contractor's designation of any invention or data as arising under an ACT transaction. The M&amp;O Contractor is responsible for curing any defect identified in such inquiry, and if the M&amp;O Contractor cannot adequately justify the designation or cure the defect, then the parties to the ACT agreement may receive modified rights in the IP to the degree necessary to resolve the issues identified by the inquiry.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(8) <em class="ph i">Intellectual Property.</em> Disposition of intellectual property (IP) arising from work conducted under this clause shall be governed by Class Waiver W(C)-2011-013 (ACT Class Waiver), which is incorporated herein by reference.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) All Contractor ACT inventions shall be reported to DOE pursuant to the requirements of the [<em class="ph i">cite Patent Rights—M&amp;O contract, Nonprofit Organization or Small Business Firm Contractor</em>] clause of this M&amp;O contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) In reporting ACT inventions, the M&amp;O Contractor shall identify the ACT agreement under which the invention was made and specify the rights reserved by the Government pursuant to the ACT Class Waiver.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iii) All technical data identified by the ACT client as Protected ACT Information shall also be marked to identify the ACT agreement under which the data was generated.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) The M&amp;O Contractor shall ensure that all rights and obligations concerning ACT IP, including the appropriate IP provisions authorized in the ACT Class Waiver, are clearly provided in ACT agreements, and that all parties granted any rights in ACT IP are informed of the terms of the waived rights, including the rights reserved by the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(v) Where the M&amp;O Contractor receives ownership or license rights to ACT IP, the M&amp;O Contractor may elect to commercialize the ACT IP consistent with the Technology Transfer Mission clause of this M&amp;O contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vi) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(8)(v) of this clause, if the M&amp;O Contractor has an authorized Private Funded Technology Transfer (PFTT) program, the M&amp;O Contractor may elect to retain private ownership of the ACT IP and commercialize the IP under its applicable PFTT clause, using its private funds, where no costs for developing, patenting, and marketing will be allowable under this M&amp;O contract. The M&amp;O Contractor will share royalties collected on ACT IP with inventors in accordance with paragraph (h) of the Technology Transfer Mission clause of this M&amp;O contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vii) For ACT projects in which the terms of the Agreement provide that the Government reserves the right to use generated data after the particular project expires, the M&amp;O Contractor must provide, to the DOE Office of Technical Information (OSTI), computer software produced under the Agreement in both source and executable object code format.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(viii) Where terms and conditions governing Data and Subject Inventions under this Contract are inconsistent with the terms of the ACT Class Waiver, the ACT Class Waiver will control.
</p>

                              </p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(i) <em class="ph i">General Indemnity.</em> (A) The M&amp;O Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Government, the Department, and persons acting on their behalf from all liability, including costs and expenses incurred, to any person, including the ACT participants, for injury to or death of persons or other living things or injury to or destruction of property arising out of the performance of an ACT transaction by the Government, the Department, the M&amp;O Contractor, or persons acting on their behalf, or arising out of the use of the services performed, materials supplied, or information given hereunder by any person including the M&amp;O Contractor, and not directly resulting from the fault or negligence of the Government, the Department, or persons (other than the M&amp;O Contractor) acting on their behalf.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) Subject to Contracting Officer approval, the General Indemnity set forth in this paragraph (b)(9)
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			may be modified or waived where:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) ACT participants are not providing material or equipment to the M&amp;O Contractor to be used in the performance of the Statement of Work under the ACT transaction; and (<em class="ph i">2</em>) ACT participants are not sending their employees to the M&amp;O facilities as part of the Statement of Work; and (<em class="ph i">3</em>) the specific activities performed under the ACT transaction are normally performed by the DOE M&amp;O Contractor under the DOE contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(C) Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(A) and (B) of this clause, the M&amp;O Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government, the Department, and persons acting on their behalf for loss, damage, or destruction of Government property resulting from the fault or negligence of the M&amp;O Contractor. Such indemnification shall be subject to a liability limit of $2,000,000 (two million dollars) per year, or such greater liability limit approved by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer under the DOE contract. Above the applicable liability limit, the M&amp;O Contractor's responsibility to the Government for such loss, damage or destruction, shall be as set forth in the “Property” clause of this contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) <em class="ph i">Intellectual Property Indemnity.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall indemnify the Government, its agents, and employees against liability, including costs, for infringement of any United States patent, copyright, or other intellectual property arising out of any acts required or directed to be performed under the Statement of Work under an ACT transaction to the extent such acts are not already performed at the M&amp;O contract facilities. Such indemnity shall not apply to a claimed infringement that is settled without the consent of the M&amp;O Contractor unless required by a court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(iii) <em class="ph i">Product Liability Indemnity.</em> (A) Except for any liability resulting from any negligent acts or omissions of the Government, the M&amp;O Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, arising from personal injury or property damage occurring as a result of the making, using, or selling of a product, process, or service by or on behalf of the ACT participants or the M&amp;O Contractor, their assignees, or licensees, which was derived from the work performed under ACT transactions. With respect to this clause, neither the Government nor the M&amp;O Contractor shall be considered assignees or licensees as a result of reserved Government rights in ACT IP. The indemnity set forth in this paragraph shall apply only if the M&amp;O Contractor shall have been informed as soon and as completely as practical by the Government of the action alleging such claim and shall have been given an opportunity, to the maximum extent afforded by applicable laws, rules, or regulations, to participate in and control its defense, and the Government shall have provided all reasonably available information and reasonable assistance requested by the M&amp;O Contractor. No settlement for which the M&amp;O Contractor would be responsible shall be made without the M&amp;O Contractor's consent, unless required by final decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) Where the M&amp;O Contractor assigns the responsibility for indemnifying the Government under paragraph (b)(9)(iii)(A) of this clause to other ACT participants, the M&amp;O Contractor agrees to seek such indemnification from the other ACT participants.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) <em class="ph i">Claims and Liabilities.</em> Claims and liabilities resulting from the M&amp;O Contractor's performance of work under an ACT transaction authorized pursuant to this clause shall not be subject to the M&amp;O contract clause entitled “Insurance—Litigation and Claims.” In no event shall the M&amp;O Contractor be reimbursed under the M&amp;O contract for liabilities (and expenses incidental to such liabilities, including litigation costs, counsel fees, and judgment and settlements) incurred as a result of third party claims related to the M&amp;O Contractor's performance under this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(v) <em class="ph i">Government Obligations.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall not include any guarantee or requirement that will obligate the Government to pay or incur any costs or create any liability on behalf of the Government in any ACT agreement or commitment the M&amp;O Contractor executes under authority of this clause. The M&amp;O Contractor agrees if the Contractor does include such a guarantee or requirement, it will have no effect on the Government, such that, the M&amp;O Contractor will be responsible for any costs or liability due to such a guarantee or requirement.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(vi) <em class="ph i">Insurance.</em> Any cost of insurance to cover risks of the M&amp;O Contractor associated with ACT agreements is unallowable under this contract.

The Government or its designees shall use such records in accordance with applicable Federal laws (including the Privacy Act), as appropriate.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(11) <em class="ph i">Termination.</em> The Government or the M&amp;O Contractor may terminate ACT authority under this contract by providing written notification of termination to the other party (Contracting Officer or the M&amp;O Contractor) as appropriate, no less than 60 days prior to the requested termination date. In such cases, the M&amp;O Contractor shall provide DOE a comprehensive list of active ACT projects. DOE anticipates work commitments under these agreements will be completed regardless of termination. All costs associated with early termination of any ACT agreements prior to the completion shall be the responsibility of the M&amp;O Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(12) <em class="ph i">Successor M&amp;O Contractor.</em> To minimize the potential for negative Government programmatic impact and to facilitate seamless transition of work to a successor M&amp;O Contractor, ACT agreement(s) executed under this clause and any contractual instruments associated therewith may be novated to the successor M&amp;O Contractor with the mutual consent of the M&amp;O Contractor, the successor M&amp;O Contractor, and the parties to the affected ACT agreement(s). If the ACT agreement(s) cannot be novated, then the M&amp;O Contractor as a private sponsor shall be permitted to enter into a Non-Federal SPP agreement with the successor M&amp;O Contractor that will enable completion of the statement of work. Such agreements shall be entered into pursuant to DOE SPP policies. DOE shall make good faith efforts to incorporate the terms of the applicable ACT agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(13) <em class="ph i">Minimum Reporting requirements.</em> The M&amp;O Contractor shall maintain records of its activities related to ACT in a manner and to the extent satisfactory to DOE and specifically including, but not limited to the number of ACT agreements, the amount of funds reimbursed to DOE for work under ACT and aggregate funding received beyond costs in the performance of ACT, the number of third party entities engaged through ACT that had not previously sponsored projects under the M&amp;O contract and the number that had not previously sponsored projects under any DOE M&amp;O contract, the amount of funds reimbursed to DOE by newly engaged entities, the number of parties and types of entities engaged in each individual ACT agreement, and the number of invention disclosures, licenses and start-ups arising from ACT. The M&amp;O Contractor shall establish performance metric(s) to measure the time required to negotiate ACT agreements in a manner consistent with the time required to negotiate CRADAs and SPPs. The M&amp;O Contractor shall obtain from each entity engaged in ACT the entity's reason(s) for selecting ACT for performance of work under the M&amp;O contract. Also, the M&amp;O Contractor shall report the above identified data annually to the DOE Contracting Officer and in such a format that will serve to adequately inform DOE of the Contractor's activities under ACT while protecting any data not subject to disclosure under this M&amp;O contract. Such records shall be made available in accordance with the clauses of this M&amp;O contract pertaining to inspection, audit and examination of records.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) The Contractor shall comply with, and assist the Department of Energy in complying with, ES&amp;H requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, and applicable directives identified in the clause of this contract entitled “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives.” The Contractor shall cooperate with Federal and non-Federal agencies having jurisdiction over ES&amp;H matters under this contract.

                                 <p class="p List1">(g) The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any noncompliance with applicable ES&amp;H requirements and the System. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment or health and safety of employees or the public, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part. Any stop work order issued by a contracting officer under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (i) of this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of the Government. In the event that the Contracting Officer issues a stop work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or additional fee or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) Regardless of the performer of the work, the Contractor is responsible for compliance with the ES&amp;H requirements applicable to this contract. The Contractor is responsible for flowing down the ES&amp;H requirements applicable to this contract to subcontracts at any tier to the extent necessary to ensure the Contractor's compliance with the requirements. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) The Contractor shall include a clause substantially the same as this clause in subcontracts involving complex or hazardous work on site at a DOE-owned or -leased facility. Such subcontracts shall provide for the right to stop work under the conditions described in paragraph (g) of this clause. Depending on the complexity and hazards associated with the work, the Contractor may choose not to require the subcontractor to submit a Safety Management System for the Contractor's review and approval.</p>

NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled activities.

Thus, if items (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> commodities, software or technologies) that are controlled by U.S. export control laws or regulations are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.

The Contractor agrees to leave a copy of such data at the facility or plant to which such data relate, and to make available for access or to deliver to the Government such data upon request by the contracting officer. If such data are limited rights data or restricted computer software, the rights of the Government in such data shall be governed solely by the provisions of paragraph (h) of this clause (“Rights in Limited Rights Data”) or paragraph (i) of this clause (“Rights in Restricted Computer Software”); and

When assertion of copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) on the data when such data are delivered to the Government as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government.

         <p class="p List4">(C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Whether the data is subject to export control; and if so, which jurisdiction;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period; and
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined exclusively by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements; or
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) Would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) The Contractor will obtain the advanced written approval of the Patent Counsel to assert copyright where data are determined to be in the following excepted categories:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Under export control restrictions;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Developed with Naval Reactors' funding;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Subject to disposition of data rights under treaties and international agreements. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified at DOE's Office of International Affairs (International Commitments—IEC).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Patent Counsel Review and Response to Contractor's Request.</em> The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 60 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor. If Patent Counsel grants permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in computer software, the permission automatically extends to subsequent minor versions (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> minor revisions, patches and bug fixes) having the same funding source, same name and substantially same functionality as the original computer software, and may be extended to subsequent major versions representing significant modifications of the program with the approval of Patent Counsel.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Permission for Contractor to Assert Copyright.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish, or make available to the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in accordance with OSTI guidelines at the time permission to assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Announcement information/metadata contained in the Software Announcement Notice 241.4;
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) the source code and/or executable file for each software program; and
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Documentation, if any, which may consist of a user manual, sample test cases, or similar information, needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software (whether included on the software media itself or provided in a separate file or in paper format).
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Unless otherwise directed by the Patent Counsel, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish, or make available to OSTI in accordance with OSTI guidelines, a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Once the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor may begin to commercialize the copyrighted data by making copyrighted data available for licensing to third parties and by offering other types of distribution to third parties. During the period in which commercialization activities pertaining to the copyrighted data are continuing, or for a specified period of time prescribed by Patent Counsel in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. For all previously approved and current copyrighted data that the Contractor is actively commercializing, the Contractor may continue to commercialize in accordance with this paragraph.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright or at the end of the specified period as prescribed by Patent Counsel, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization activities for copyrighted data, the Contractor shall advise OSTI and Patent Counsel and, upon request, assign the copyright to the Government so that the Government can distribute the copyrighted data to the public. When the Contractor abandons commercialization activities, the Contractor will provide to OSTI the latest version of the copyrighted data (for example, source code, object code, minimal support documentation, drawings or updated manuals.) In addition, the Contractor will provide annually to Patent Counsel, if requested, a list of all copyrighted data that the Contractor has abandoned commercial licensing activity during that year.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) and (v) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office, or when submitted for publication. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be substantially similar to the following:
</p>
         <p class="p P">
                                 <em class="ph i">Notice:</em> These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. ___ with the Department of Energy. During the period of commercialization or such other time period specified by the Department of Energy, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Subsequent to that period the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data, apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.
</p>
         <p class="p HD3">(End of notice)
</p>
         <p class="p P">(viii) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the period that Contractor is commercializing the data as provided for in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause. Before licensing under this paragraph, DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65—“Appeals.”
</p>
         <p class="p P">(ix) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(4) The following notice may be included in computer software prior to any publication or release and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this clause.

All rights in the computer software are reserved by DOE on behalf of the United States Government and the Contractor as provided in the Contract. You are authorized to use this computer software for Governmental purposes but it is not to be released or distributed to the public. NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE CONTRACTOR MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ASSUMES ANY LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. This notice including this sentence must appear on any copies of this computer software.
</p>
         <p class="p HD3">(End of notice)
</p>
         <p class="p P">(5) A similar notice can be used for data, other than computer software, prior to any publication or release and prior to Contractor's obtaining permission of DOE Patent Counsel to assert copyright.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Open software source.</em> The Contractor may release computer software first produced by the Contractor in the performance of this contract under an open source software license. Such software shall hereinafter be referred to as open source software or OSS, subject to the following:
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(1) <em class="ph i">DOE Program notice for copyright assertion for OSS.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			The Contractor shall provide written notice (including relevant data such as, for example, the software disclosure form) to each DOE Program or Programs that have provided a substantial portion of the funding (funding source(s)) to develop the software that the Contractor intends to release as OSS unless the funding Program(s) has previously provided blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that Program or a specific DOE project stipulates the software to be released as OSS. If Program has neither consented nor objected to the assertion of copyright within two weeks of such written notification, the Contractor may assert copyright in the software. If notification of a funding DOE Program(s) is not practicable or DOE Program(s) has objected, the Contractor shall consult with Patent Counsel, which may provide approval. For software developed under a CRADA, Strategic Partnership Projects (SPP), User Facility Agreement, or Agreement for Commercializing Technology (ACT), authorization from the partner of such agreement shall be additionally obtained for OSS release unless such agreement has a provision providing for such copyright assertion.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) If the software is developed with funding from a federal government agency or agencies (funding source(s)) other than DOE, then authorization from all the funding agency(ies) shall be obtained for OSS release, if practicable. Such federal government agency(ies) may provide blanket approval for all software developed with funding from that agency(ies). However, OSS release of any one of such software shall be subject to approval by all other funding sources for the software, if any. If approval from such federal government agency(ies) is not practicable, the Patent Counsel may provide approval instead.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Assert copyright in the OSS.</em> Once the Contractor has met the program approval requirements set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, copyright in the software to be distributed as OSS may be asserted by the Contractor, or, for OSS developed under a CRADA, User Facility Agreement, or SPP Agreement, either by the Contractor, CRADA Participant, User Facility User, or SPP Sponsor, as applicable, which precludes marking such OSS as protectable from public distribution.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Submit Software Announcement Notice 241.4 to OSTI.</em> The Contractor must submit Software Announcement Notice (AN) 241.4 (or the current notice as may be required by DOE) to OSTI. In the AN 241.4, the Contractor shall provide the unique URL (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> a persistent identifier) from which the software can be obtained so that OSTI can announce the availability of the OSS and the public has access via the URL.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Maintain OSS record.</em> The Contractor must maintain a record of all software distributed as OSS. Upon request of the Patent Counsel, the Contractor shall provide the necessary information regarding any or all OSS.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Provide public access to the OSS.</em> The Contractor shall ensure that the OSS is publicly accessible as open source via the Contractor's website, Open Source Bulletin Boards operated by third parties, DOE, or other standard industry methods.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Select an OSS license.</em> Each OSS will be distributed pursuant to an OSS license. The Contractor may choose among industry standard OSS licenses or create its own set of Contractor standard licenses. To assist the Contractor, the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property, may periodically issue guidance on OSS licenses. Each Contractor-created OSS license, must contain, at a minimum, the following provisions—
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A disclaimer or equivalent that disclaims the Government's and Contractor's liability for licensees' and third parties' use of the software; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A grant of permission for licensee to distribute OSS containing the licensee's derivative works. This provision may allow the licensee and third parties to commercialize their derivative works or might request that the licensee's derivative works be forwarded to the Contractor for incorporation into future OSS versions.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) <em class="ph i">Relationship to other required clauses in the contract.</em> OSS distributed in accordance with this section shall not be subject to the requirements relating to indemnification of the Contractor or Federal Government, U.S. Competitiveness and U.S. Preference, as set forth in paragraphs (f) and (g) of the clause within this contract entitled Technology Transfer Mission (48 CFR 970.5227-3). The requirement for the Contractor to request permission to assert copyright for the purpose of engaging in licensing software for royalties, as set forth elsewhere in this clause, is not modified by this section.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8) <em class="ph i">Government license.</em> For all OSS, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in data copyrighted in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this clause to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(9) <em class="ph i">Contractor abandons OSS.</em> If the Contractor ceases to make OSS publicly available, then the Contractor shall submit to OSTI the object code and source code of the latest version of the OSS developed by the Contractor in addition to a revised Announcement Notice 241.4 (which includes an abstract) and the Contractor shall direct any inquiries from third parties seeking to obtain the original OSS to OSTI.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Subcontracting.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Unless otherwise directed by the Patent Counsel, the Contractor agrees to use in subcontracts in which technical data or computer software is expected to be produced or in subcontracts for supplies that contain a requirement for production or delivery of data in accordance with the DOE policy and procedures, the clause entitled, “Rights in Data-General” at 48 CFR 52.227-14 modified in accordance with 48 CFR 927.409 including alternates as appropriate with the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. The Contractor shall not acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software, except through the use of Alternate II or III, respectively, without the prior approval of the Patent Counsel. The clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be included in subcontracts in accordance with 48 CFR 927.409(d). In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated under its contract with DOE, the Contractor shall use the “Rights in Data-Facilities” clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) It is the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain from its subcontractors technical data and computer software and rights therein, on behalf of the Government, necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government with respect to such data. In the event of refusal by a subcontractor to accept a clause affording the Government such rights, the Contractor shall:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Promptly submit written notice to the contracting officer setting forth reasons or the subcontractor's refusal and other pertinent information which may expedite disposition of the matter, and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the contracting officer.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Neither the Contractor nor higher-tier subcontractors shall use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data and restricted computer software for their private use.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Filing of patent applications by the Contractor.</em> The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, or prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding first filed patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
</p>

This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license.</em> Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

The subcontractor retains all rights provided for the contractor in the patent rights clause at 37 CFR 401.3(a) and 401.14. If the S&amp;E DEC, or any other related DEC, is applicable (see paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause), the Contractor shall use Alternate II of DEAR 952.227-11, Patent Rights—Retention by the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Inclusion of patent rights clause—subcontractors other than non-profit organizations and small business firms.</em> Except for the subcontracts described in paragraph (g)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, suitably modified to identify the parties, in any contract for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work. For subcontracts subject to a patent waiver granted by DOE Patent Counsel, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause. For subcontracts subject to exceptional circumstances, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause which may require the use of Alternate II of 48 CFR 952.227-13 Patent Rights—Acquisition by the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(4) <em class="ph i">DOE and subcontractor contract.</em> With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.

The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.

However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">March-in Rights.</em> The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right under 35 U.S.C. 203 and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself under applicable law stated above.

The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business firm applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this paragraph (k)(2).

The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (t)(1). The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Waivers.</em> The Contractor (or any entity subject to this paragraph) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause. Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that 
				</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) 
			the Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible and (B) a waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Final determination of breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause.</em> If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions subject to the breach to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer &amp; Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) <em class="ph i">License, Assignment, or Transfer.</em> Pursuant to Contractor's agreement in paragraph (t)(1) of this clause to not license, assign or otherwise transfer rights to subject inventions at any tier unless the entity agrees to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause: any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (t)(1) of this clause suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) <em class="ph i">Compensation.</em> For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, unless DOE grants a license through a separately agreed upon licensing agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(u) <em class="ph i">Publication.</em> The Contractor shall receive approval from Patent Counsel prior to releasing or publishing information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, to ensure such release or publication does not adversely affect the patent rights of DOE or the Contractor. At the discretion of the Patent Counsel, authority to review publications prior to release may be delegated to the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(v) <em class="ph i">Termination of contractor's advance class waiver.</em> If a request by the Contractor for an advance class waiver pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause contains false material statements or fails to disclose material facts, and DOE relies on the false statements or omissions in granting the Contractor's request, the waiver or grant of any Government rights (in whole or in part) to the subject invention(s) may be terminated at the discretion of the Secretary of Energy or designee. Prior to termination, DOE shall provide the Contractor with written notification of the termination, including a statement of facts in support of the termination, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days, or a longer period authorized by the Secretary of Energy or designee for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor, to show cause for not terminating the waiver or grant. Any termination of an advance class waiver or a determination of greater rights is subject to the Contractor's license as provided for in paragraph (f) of this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(w) <em class="ph i">Unauthorized Access.</em> The contractor will protect all invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information from unauthorized access and disclosure using at least commonly available techniques and practices. In the event that the Contractor becomes aware of unauthorized access to invention reports, unpublished patent applications and other invention related information, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel within 7 days.

The amounts shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction subcontracts greater than $35,000, but not greater than $150,000, the Contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR 28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the liability of any one surety exceed the maximum sum for which it is qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of acceptable corporate sureties.
