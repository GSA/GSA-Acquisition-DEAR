The clause is required for all DOE prime contracts that involve any possibility of contractor access to Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause specifies various degrees of violations and the amount of reduction attributable to each degree. The clause at 952.242-71, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, or Other Incentives, shall be used to comply with 42 U.S.C. 2282b (unless the clause at 970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts is used).

Although DOE utilizes the National Industrial Security Program, DOE's security authority is derived from the Atomic Energy Act which contains specific language not found in other agencies' authorities. For this reason, DOE contracts must contain the clause at 952.204-2 rather than the clause at FAR 52.204-2 and Contracting Officers must incorporate DOE Form 470.1 or equivalent.

         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Disclosure of information, 952.204-72.</em> This clause may be used in place of the clauses entitled “Security” and “Classification” in contracts with educational institutions for research work performed in their own institute facilities that are not likely to produce classified information.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Facility Clearance, 952.204-73.</em> This solicitation provision should be used in solicitations expected to result in contracts and subcontracts that require employees to possess access authorizations.

The contracting officer need not prepare a separate finding and determination addressing FOCI; however, the memorandum of negotiation shall include a discussion of the applicability of this subpart and the resulting determination.

         <p class="p List1">(c) The types of plans that a contractor can propose are: measures which provide for physical or organizational separation of the facility or organizational component containing the classified information or special nuclear material; modification or termination of agreements with foreign interests; diversification or reduction of foreign source income; assignment of specific security duties and responsibilities to board members or special executive level committees; or any other actions to negate or reduce FOCI to acceptable levels. The plan of action may vary with the type of foreign interest involved, degree of ownership, and information involved so that each plan must be negotiated on a case by case basis. If the offeror(s) or contractor and the DOE cannot negotiate a plan of action that isolates the offeror(s) or contractor from FOCI satisfactory to the DOE, then the offeror(s) shall not be considered for contract award and affected existing contracts with a contractor shall be terminated.
