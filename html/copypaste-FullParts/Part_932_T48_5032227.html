         <p class="p List1">(d) In the case of prime contracts, when it has been determined that the financing of contracts will be facilitated in the interest of DOE programs, it is the policy of DOE that such contracts provide, or be amended without consideration (see Assignment of Claims Act of 1940) to provide, in conformance with 48 CFR 32.804, that payments to be made to an assignee shall not be subject to reduction or setoff. In the case of subcontracts, when loans are made for the purpose of financing performance of subcontracts under DOE prime contracts, financing institutions or the Government as guarantor in those instances in which such loans are guaranteed should not be required to incur risks of loss by reason of possible diversion of assigned subcontracts proceeds for payment of other claims of the prime contractor against the borrower, otherwise unrelated to the assigned subcontracts. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall require the adoption of these policies and practices by DOE prime contractors with respect to DOE subcontract work. The Head of the Contracting Activity should inform the Chief Financial Officer, Headquarters of each DOE contractor who is unwilling to adopt policies consistent with this paragraph and the reasons given in support of the contractor's position.

Considerations include, but are not limited to, the nature of supplies or services involved, geographical site location, inspection and testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and available DOE resources.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Accelerated payments to limit contractor working capital requirements.</em> Contracting Officers may specify payment due dates that are less than the standard under the Prompt Payment Act when a determination is made, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that a shorter contract financing payment cycle will be beneficial to the Government by reducing the contractor's working capital requirements. In such cases, the Contracting Officer should coordinate with the finance and program officials that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that the contract payment terms to be specified in solicitations and resulting contract awards will provide sufficient time for officials to perform an appropriate review of the invoices before they are paid. Consideration should be given to geographical separation, workload, contractor ability to submit a proper request, and other factors that could affect timing of payment. However, payment due dates that are less than 7 days for progress payments or less than 14 days for interim payments on cost-type contracts are not authorized. In all cases whereby the contract specifies payment due dates that are sooner than those required under the relevant prompt payment requirements, the contract will permit the Contracting Officer to unilaterally authorize additional time for review of invoices if needed to perform an adequate review of those invoices prior to payment.
