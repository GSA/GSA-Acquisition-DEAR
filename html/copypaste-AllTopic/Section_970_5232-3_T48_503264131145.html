</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">Remedies.</em> If at any time during contract performance, the Contracting Officer determines that unallowable costs were claimed by the Contractor to the extent of making the contractor's management controls suspect, or the contractor's management systems that validate costs incurred and claimed suspect, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her sole discretion, require the Contractor to cease using the special financial institution account in whole or with regard to specified accounts, requiring reimbursable costs to be claimed by periodic vouchering. In addition, the Contracting Officer, where he or she deems it appropriate, may: Impose a penalty under 48 CFR 970.5242-1, Penalties for Unallowable Costs; require a refund; reduce the contractor's otherwise earned fee; and take such other action as authorized in law, regulation, or this contract.</p>
