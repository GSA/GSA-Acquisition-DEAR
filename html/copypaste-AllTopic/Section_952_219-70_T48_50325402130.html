Mentor and Protege firms will develop and submit “lessons learned” evaluations to DOE at the conclusion of the contract. Any DOE contractor that is interested in becoming a Mentor should refer to the applicable regulations at 48 CFR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_919_70_T48_50321186.html#Subpart_919_70_T48_50321186">919.70</a> and should contact the Department of Energy's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.</p>
