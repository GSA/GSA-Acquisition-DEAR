         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			<em class="ph i">Subject invention disclosure.</em> The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Patent Counsel within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written or electronic report and shall identify the contract or any other agreement under which the invention was made and the inventor(s) and all sources of funding by Budget and Resources (B&amp;R) code for the invention.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Filing of patent applications by the Contractor.</em> The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, or prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding first filed patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(4) <em class="ph i">Contractor's request for an extension of time.</em> Requests for an extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of Patent Counsel, be granted.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c), but prior to its receipt of the written request of the DOE, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) <em class="ph i">Revocation or modification of a Contractor license.</em> The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781. This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country.
</p>
         <p class="p P">(3) <em class="ph i">Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license.</em> Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(3) <em class="ph i">Notification of discontinuation of patent protection.</em> The contractor will notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to file a patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 60 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.

In addition, the Contractor shall provide data to DOE for the annual data call for the Department of Commerce report that includes the number of patent applications filed, the number of patents issued, licensing activity, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Preference for United States Industry.</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">March-in Rights.</em> The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right under 35 U.S.C. 203 and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself under applicable law stated above.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(k) <em class="ph i">Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations.</em> If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">DOE approval of assignment of rights.</em> Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions of this clause as the Contractor.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Small business firm licensees.</em> It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business firm applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this paragraph (k)(2).
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Contractor licensing of subject inventions.</em> To the extent that it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at the facility.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(l) <em class="ph i">Communications.</em> The Contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel assisting the DOE contracting activity.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) <em class="ph i">Final reports.</em> Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract, a list of all subject inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract performance period; and a list of all subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance period under which a subject invention was reported, or a statement that no such subject inventions under subcontracts were reported during the contract performance period.

</p>
         <p class="p P">(2) <em class="ph i">Unreported inventions.</em> If the Contracting Officer is aware of an invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject invention, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure of the invention for a determination of ownership rights.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(o) <em class="ph i">Facilities License.</em> In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the Contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or product manufactured at the facility.

			Consistent with 48 CFR 970.5227-3(f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, for all subject inventions under the S&amp;E DEC, the Contractor agrees that any products embodying any subject invention or produced through the use of any subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States unless the Contractor can show to the satisfaction of DOE that it is not commercially feasible. In the event DOE agrees to foreign manufacture, there will be a requirement that the Government's support of the technology be recognized in some appropriate manner, <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> alternative binding commitments to provide an overall net benefit to the U.S. economy. The Contractor agrees that it will not license, assign or otherwise transfer any subject invention to any entity, at any tier, unless that entity agrees to these same requirements. In the event that the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights in the Subject Invention undergoes a change in ownership amounting to a controlling interest, the Contractor or other such entity receiving rights shall ensure continual compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			and shall inform DOE, in writing, of the change in ownership within six months of the change. The Contractor and any successor assignee will convey to DOE, upon written request from DOE, title to any subject invention, upon a breach of this paragraph (t)(1). The Contractor will include this paragraph (t) in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The requirements, rights and administration of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause are further clarified as follows:
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Waivers.</em> The Contractor (or any entity subject to this paragraph) may request a waiver or modification of paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause. Such waivers or modifications may be granted when DOE determines that:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(A) The Contractor (or any entity subject to paragraph (t)(1) of this clause) has demonstrated, with quantifiable data, that manufacturing in the United States is not commercially feasible; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(B) A waiver or modification would best serve the interests of the United States and the general public.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(ii) <em class="ph i">Final determination of breach of paragraph (t)(1) of this clause.</em> If DOE determines the Contractor is in breach of paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause, the Department may issue a final written determination of such breach. If such determination includes a demand for title to the subject inventions under the award, the demand for title will cause an immediate conveyance and assignment of all rights to all subject inventions subject to the breach to the United States Government, including all pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and all U.S. and foreign patents that cover any subject invention, without compensation. Any such final determination shall be signed by the cognizant DOE Contracting Officer with the concurrence of the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer &amp; Intellectual Property. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the Contractor before any final written determination by DOE is issued.
</p>

				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause: any such license, assignment, or other transfer of right to any subject invention developed under the award shall contain paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause suitably modified to properly identify the parties. If a licensee, assignee, or other transferee of rights to any subject invention is finally determined by DOE in writing to be in breach of paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause, the applicable license, assignment or other transfer shall be deemed null and void. Advanced notice will be provided for comment to the non-complying party before any final written determination by DOE is made.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(iv) For clarity, if the forfeiture of title to any subject invention is due to a breach of paragraph (t)
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			of this clause, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation, or to a license to the subject invention including the reserved license in paragraph (e)
