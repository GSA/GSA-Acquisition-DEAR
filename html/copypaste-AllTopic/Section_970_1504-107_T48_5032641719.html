         <p class="p List1">(a) There are five classification factors. They are tied to facility/task categories. Step 4 in calculating the maximum total available fee amount for the one-year period (see 970.1504-104(b)(4)) is to multiply the fee subtotal in step 3 for each type of effort by the appropriate classification factor. The classification factors and their corresponding facility/task categories are:
