			The amount of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by a contractor during an evaluation period may be reduced in accordance with this clause if it is determined that a performance failure warranting a reduction under this clause occurs within the evaluation period. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) The amount of reduction under this clause, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract, shall not exceed the amount of fee, fixed fee, profit, or the Contractor's share of cost savings that is otherwise earned during the evaluation period. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) For the purposes of this clause, earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings for the evaluation period shall mean the amount determined by the Contracting Officer or fee determination official as otherwise payable based on the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where the contract provides for financial incentives that extend beyond a single evaluation period, this amount shall also include: any provisional amounts determined otherwise payable in the evaluation period; and, if provisional payments are not provided for, the allocable amount of any incentive determined otherwise payable at the conclusion of a subsequent evaluation period. The allocable amount shall be the total amount of the earned incentive divided by the number of evaluation periods over which it was earned.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) The Government will effect the reduction as soon as practicable after the end of the evaluation period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practical after becoming aware. For any portion of the reduction requiring an allocation the Government will effect the reduction at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount earned under the incentive. If at any time a reduction causes the sum of the payments the Contractor has received for fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings to exceed the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned (provisionally or otherwise), the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.)

                                 <p class="p List4">(A) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(B) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.)

Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS is considered first degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered first degree. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1B, or successor version).

They include failures to comply with an approved ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences. They also include breakdowns of the Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1B, or successor version).

                                 <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Third Degree:</em> Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&amp;H. They include failures to comply with an approved ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through: external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 232.1-2 requirements; or internal oversight of DOE Order 440.1A requirements. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant negative impacts to the worker, the public, or the environment or that indicate a significant programmatic breakdown. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.

                                 <p class="p List3">(i) The requirements with specific incentives which do not require the achievement of cost efficiencies in order to be performed at the level of performance set forth in the Statement of Work, Work Authorization Directive, or similar document unless an otherwise minimum level of performance has been established in the specific incentive; 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) All of the performance requirements directly related to requirements specifically incentivized which do not require the achievement of cost efficiencies in order to be performed at a level of performance such that the overall performance of these related requirements is at an acceptable level; and 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) All other requirements at a level of performance such that the total performance of the contract is not jeopardized. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The evaluation of the Contractor's achievement of the level of performance shall be unilaterally determined by the Government. To the extent that the Contractor fails to achieve the minimum performance levels specified in the Statement of Work, Work Authorization Directive, or similar document, during the performance evaluation period, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, may reduce any otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings for the performance evaluation period. Such reduction shall not result in the total of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings being less than 25 percent of the total available fee amount. Such 25 percent shall include base fee, if any. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Minimum requirements for cost performance.</em>

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Requirements incentivized by other than cost incentives must be performed within their specified cost constraint and must not adversely impact the costs of performing unrelated activities. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The performance of requirements with a specific cost incentive must not adversely impact the costs of performing unrelated requirements. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor's performance within the stipulated cost performance levels for the performance evaluation period shall be determined by the Government. To the extent the Contractor fails to achieve the stipulated cost performance levels, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, may reduce in whole or in part any otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings for the performance evaluation period. Such reduction shall not result in the total of earned fee, fixed fee, profit or shared net savings being less than 25 percent of the total available fee amount. Such 25 percent shall include base fee, if any.</p>
