Annually, or at other intervals directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall supply to the Contracting Officer copies of the reports reflecting the status of recommendations resulting from management audits performed by its internal audit activity and any other audit organization. This requirement may be satisfied in part by the reports required under paragraph
