         <p class="p Runin List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Withholding of data.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Data that is first produced as a result of research and development activities conducted under a CRADA and that would be a trade secret or commercial or financial data that would be privileged or confidential, if such data had been obtained from a non-Federal third party, may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(7)) for a period as agreed in the CRADA of up to five (5) years from the time the data is first produced or otherwise as delineated in Stevenson-Wydler, as amended. The DOE shall cooperate with the Contractor in protecting such data.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Unless otherwise expressly approved by the contracting officer in advance for a specific CRADA, the Contractor agrees, at the request of the contracting officer, to transmit such data to other DOE facilities for use by DOE or its Contractors by or on behalf of the Government. When data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause is so transferred, the Contractor shall clearly mark the data with a legend setting out the restrictions against private use and further dissemination, along with the expiration date of such restrictions.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) A final technical report, upon completion of a CRADA, shall be provided to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information; reports marked as Protected CRADA Information will not be released to the public for a period in accordance with the terms of the CRADA.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) In addition to its authority to license Intellectual Property, the Contractor may enter into licensing agreements with third parties for data developed by the Contractor under a CRADA subject to other provisions of this Contract. However, the Contractor shall neither use the protection against dissemination nor the licensing of data as an alternative to the submittal of invention disclosures which include data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(4) <em class="ph i">SPP, ACT and user facility programs.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			SPP, ACT and User Facility Agreements (UFAs) may be available for use by the Contractor in addition to CRADAs. The Contractor agrees to inform prospective CRADA participants, which are intending to substantially pay full cost recovery for the effort under a proposed CRADA, of the availability of alternative forms of agreements, <em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> SPP, ACT and UFA, and of the Class Patent Waiver provisions associated therewith.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Where the Contractor believes that the transfer of technology to the U.S. domestic economy will benefit from, or other equity considerations dictate, an arrangement other than the Class Waiver of patent rights to the sponsor in SPP, ACT and UFAs, a request may be made to the contracting officer for an exception to the Class Waivers.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Rights to inventions made under agreements other than funding agreements with third parties shall be governed by the appropriate provisions incorporated, with DOE approval, in such agreements, and the provisions in such agreements take precedence over any disposition of rights contained in this Contract. Disposition of rights under any such agreement shall be in accordance with any DOE class waiver (including SPP, ACT and User Class Waivers) or individually negotiated waiver which applies to the agreement.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Conflicts of interest.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Except as provided in paragraph (n)(5)(iii) of this clause, the Contractor shall assure that no employee of the Contractor shall have a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the negotiation, approval or performance of a CRADA, if, to such employee's knowledge:
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Such employee, or the spouse, child, parent, sibling, or partner of such employee, or an organization (other than the Contractor) in which such employee serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee—
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(1) Holds financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the entity of the CRADA; or
</p>
         <p class="p List5">(2) Receives a gift or gratuity from any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the entity of the CRADA; or
</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) A financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the entity of the CRADA, is held by any person or organization with whom such employee is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contractor shall require that each employee of the Contractor who has a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the negotiation, approval or performance of the CRADA certify through the Contractor to the contracting officer that the circumstances described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause do not apply to that employee.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (n)(5)(i) and (ii) of this clause shall not apply in a case where the contracting officer is advised by the Contractor in advance of the participation of an employee described in those paragraphs of the nature of and extent of any financial interest described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause, and the contracting officer determines that such financial interest is not so substantial as to be considered likely to affect the integrity of the Contractor employee's participation in the process of negotiation, approval or performance of the CRADA.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(o) <em class="ph i">Technology transfer in other cost-sharing agreements.</em> In conducting research and development activities in cost-shared agreements not covered by paragraph (n) of this clause, the Contractor, with prior written permission of the contracting officer, may provide for the withholding of data produced thereunder in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (n)(3) of this clause.
</p>
         <p class="p Runin List1">(p) <em class="ph i">Technology partnership ombudsman.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Contractor agrees to establish a position to be known as “Technology Partnership Ombudsman,” to help resolve complaints from outside organizations regarding the policies and actions of the contractor with respect to technology partnerships (including CRADAs), patents owned by the contractor for inventions made at the laboratory, and technology licensing.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Ombudsman shall be a senior official of the Contactor's laboratory staff, who is not involved in day-to-day technology partnerships, patents or technology licensing, or, if appointed from outside the laboratory or facility, shall function as such senior official.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The duties of the Technology Partnership Ombudsman shall include:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Serving as the focal point for assisting the public and industry in resolving complaints and disputes with the laboratory or facility regarding technology partnerships, patents, and technology licensing;
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Promoting the use of collaborative alternative dispute resolution techniques such as mediation to facilitate the speedy and low cost resolution of complaints and disputes, when appropriate; and
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Submitting a quarterly report, in a format provided by DOE, to the Director of the DOE Office of Dispute Resolution, and the Contracting Officer concerning the number and nature of complaints and disputes raised, along with the Ombudsman's assessment of their resolution, consistent with the protection of confidential and sensitive information.
