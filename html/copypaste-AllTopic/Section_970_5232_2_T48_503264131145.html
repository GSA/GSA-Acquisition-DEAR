         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1), insert the following clause:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Payments and Advances (DEC 2000)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Installments of fixed-fee.</em> The fixed-fee payable under this contract shall become due and payable in periodic installments in accordance with a schedule determined by the Contracting Officer. Fixed-fee payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No fixed-fee payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Payments on Account of Allowable Costs.</em> The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall agree as to the extent to which payment for allowable costs or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer (for example, negotiated fixed amounts) shall be made from advances of Government funds. When pension contributions are paid by the Contractor to the retirement fund less frequently than quarterly, accrued costs therefore shall be excluded from costs for payment purposes until such costs are paid. If pension contribution are paid on a quarterly or more frequent basis, accrual therefore may be included in costs for payment purposes, provided that they are paid to the fund within 30 days after the close of the period covered. If payments are not made to the fund within such 30-day period, pension contribution costs shall be excluded from cost for payment purposes until payment has been made. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Special financial institution account - use.</em> All advances of Government funds shall be withdrawn pursuant to a payments cleared financing arrangement prescribed by DOE in favor of the financial institution or, at the option of the Government, shall be made by direct payment or other payment mechanism to the Contractor, and shall be deposited only in the special financial institution account referred to in the Special Financial Institution Account Agreement, which is incorporated into this contract as Appendix - . No part of the funds in the special financial institution account shall be commingled with any funds of the Contractor or used for a purpose other than that of making payments for costs allowable and, if applicable, fees earned under this contract, negotiated fixed amounts, or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer determines that the balance of such special financial institution account exceeds the Contractor's current needs, the Contractor shall promptly make such disposition of the excess as the Contracting Officer may direct.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Title to funds advanced.</em> Title to the unexpended balance of any funds advanced and of any special financial institution account established pursuant to this clause shall remain in the Government and be superior to any claim or lien of the financial institution of deposit or others. It is understood that an advance to the Contractor hereunder is not a loan to the Contractor, and will not require the payment of interest by the Contractor, and that the Contractor acquires no right, title or interest in or to such advance other than the right to make expenditures therefrom, as provided in this clause. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Financial settlement.</em> The Government shall promptly pay to the Contractor the unpaid balance of allowable costs (or other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) and fee upon termination of the work, expiration of the term of the contract, or completion of the work and its acceptance by the Government after -

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Discounts.</em> The Contractor shall take and afford the Government the advantage of all known and available cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, and commissions unless the Contracting Officer finds that action is not in the best interest of the Government.
